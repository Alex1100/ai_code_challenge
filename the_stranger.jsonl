{"text":"The Stranger\n\nALBERT CAMUS\nTranslated from the French by Stuart Gilbert\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPart One\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nV\n\nVI\n\nPart Two\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nV\nPart One\nI\nMOTHER died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can’t be sure. The telegram\nfrom the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL\nTOMORROW. DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it\ncould have been yesterday.\n\nThe Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers.\nWith the two o’clock bus I should get there well before nightfall. Then I can\nspend the night there, keeping the usual vigil beside the body, and be back\nhere by tomorrow evening. I have fixed up with my employer for two days’\nleave; obviously, under the circumstances, he couldn’t refuse. Still, I had an\nidea he looked annoyed, and I said, without thinking: “Sorry, sir, but it’s not\nmy fault, you know.”\n\nAfterwards it struck me I needn’t have said that. I had no reason to excuse\nmyself; it was up to him to express his sympathy and so forth. Probably he\nwill do so the day after tomorrow, when he sees me in black. For the\npresent, it’s almost as if Mother weren’t really dead. The funeral will bring\nit home to me, put an official seal on it, so to speak. ...\n\nI took the two-o’clock bus. It was a blazing hot afternoon. I’d lunched, as\nusual, at Céleste’s restaurant. Everyone was most kind, and Céleste said to\nme, “There’s no one like a mother.” When I left they came with me to the\ndoor. It was something of a rush, getting away, as at the last moment I had\nto call in at Emmanuel’s place to borrow his black tie and mourning band.\nHe lost his uncle a few months ago.\n\nI had to run to catch the bus. I suppose it was my hurrying like that, what\nwith the glare off the road and from the sky, the reek of gasoline, and the\njolts, that made me feel so drowsy. Anyhow, I slept most of the way. When\nI woke I was leaning against a soldier; he grinned and asked me if I’d come\nfrom a long way off, and I just nodded, to cut things short. I wasn’t in a\nmood for talking.\n\nThe Home is a little over a mile from the village. I went there on foot. I\nasked to be allowed to see Mother at once, but the doorkeeper told me I\nmust see the warden first. He wasn’t free, and I had to wait a bit. The\ndoorkeeper chatted with me while I waited; then he led me to the office.\nThe warden was a very small man, with gray hair, and a Legion of Honor\nrosette in his buttonhole. He gave me a long look with his watery blue eyes.\nThen we shook hands, and he held mine so long that I began to feel\nembarrassed. After that he consulted a register on his table, and said:\n\n“Madame Meursault entered the Home three years ago. She had no private\nmeans and depended entirely on you.”\n\nI had a feeling he was blaming me for something, and started to explain.\nBut he cut me short.\n\n“There’s no need to excuse yourself, my boy. I’ve looked up the record and\nobviously you weren’t in a position to see that she was properly cared for.\nShe needed someone to be with her all the time, and young men in jobs like\nyours don’t get too much pay. In any case, she was much happier in the\nHome.”\n\nI said, “Yes, sir; I’m sure of that.”\n\nThen he added: “She had good friends here, you know, old folks like\nherself, and one gets on better with people of one’s own generation. You’re\nmuch too young; you couldn’t have been much of a companion to her.”\n\nThat was so. When we lived together, Mother was always watching me, but\nwe hardly ever talked. During her first few weeks at the Home she used to\ncry a good deal. But that was only because she hadn’t settled down. After a\nmonth or two she’d have cried if she’d been told to leave the Home.\nBecause this, too, would have been a wrench. That was why, during the last\nyear, I seldom went to see her. Also, it would have meant losing my Sunday\n—not to mention the trouble of going to the bus, getting my ticket, and\nspending two hours on the journey each way.\n\nThe warden went on talking, but I didn’t pay much attention. Finally he\nsaid:\n\n“Now, I suppose you’d like to see your mother?”\nI rose without replying, and he led the way to the door. As we were going\ndown the stairs he explained:\n\n“I’ve had the body moved to our little mortuary—so as not to upset the\nother old people, you understand. Every time there’s a death here, they’re in\na nervous state for two or three days. Which means, of course, extra work\nand worry for our staff.”\n\nWe crossed a courtyard where there were a number of old men, talking\namongst themselves in little groups. They fell silent as we came up with\nthem. Then, behind our backs, the chattering began again. Their voices\nreminded me of parakeets in a cage, only the sound wasn’t quite so shrill.\nThe warden stopped outside the entrance of a small, low building.\n\n“So here I leave you, Monsieur Meursault. If you want me for anything,\nyou’ll find me in my office. We propose to have the funeral tomorrow\nmorning. That will enable you to spend the night beside your mother’s\ncoffin, as no doubt you would wish to do. Just one more thing; I gathered\nfrom your mother’s friends that she wished to be buried with the rites of the\nChurch. I’ve made arrangements for this; but I thought I should let you\nknow.”\n\nI thanked him. So far as I knew, my mother, though not a professed atheist,\nhad never given a thought to religion in her life.\n\nI entered the mortuary. It was a bright, spotlessly clean room, with\nwhitewashed walls and a big skylight. The furniture consisted of some\nchairs and trestles. Two of the latter stood open in the center of the room\nand the coffin rested on them. The lid was in place, but the screws had been\ngiven only a few turns and their nickeled heads stuck out above the wood,\nwhich was stained dark walnut. An Arab woman—a nurse, I supposed—\nwas sitting beside the bier; she was wearing a blue smock and had a rather\ngaudy scarf wound round her hair.\n\nJust then the keeper came up behind me. He’d evidently been running, as he\nwas a little out of breath.\n“We put the lid on, but I was told to unscrew it when you came, so that you\ncould see her.”\n\nWhile he was going up to the coffin I told him not to trouble.\n\n“Eh? What’s that?” he exclaimed. “You don’t want me to ...?”\n\n“No,” I said.\n\nHe put back the screwdriver in his pocket and stared at me. I realized then\nthat I shouldn’t have said, “No,” and it made me rather embarrassed. After\neying me for some moments he asked:\n\n“Why not?” But he didn’t sound reproachful; he simply wanted to know.\n\n“Well, really I couldn’t say,” I answered.\n\nHe began twiddling his white mustache; then, without looking at me, said\ngently:\n\n“I understand.”\n\nHe was a pleasant-looking man, with blue eyes and ruddy cheeks. He drew\nup a chair for me near the coffin, and seated himself just behind. The nurse\ngot up and moved toward the door. As she was going by, the keeper\nwhispered in my ear:\n\n“It’s a tumor she has, poor thing.”\n\nI looked at her more carefully and I noticed that she had a bandage round\nher head, just below her eyes. It lay quite flat across the bridge of her nose,\nand one saw hardly anything of her face except that strip of whiteness.\n\nAs soon as she had gone, the keeper rose.\n\n“Now I’ll leave you to yourself.”\n\nI don’t know whether I made some gesture, but instead of going he halted\nbehind my chair. The sensation of someone posted at my back made me\nuncomfortable. The sun was getting low and the whole room was flooded\nwith a pleasant, mellow light. Two hornets were buzzing overhead, against\nthe skylight. I was so sleepy I could hardly keep my eyes open. Without\nlooking round, I asked the keeper how long he’d been at the Home. “Five\nyears.” The answer came so pat that one could have thought he’d been\nexpecting my question.\n\nThat started him off, and he became quite chatty. If anyone had told him ten\nyears ago that he’d end his days as doorkeeper at a home at Marengo, he’d\nnever have believed it. He was sixty-four, he said, and hailed from Paris.\n\nWhen he said that, I broke in. “Ah, you don’t come from here?”\n\nI remembered then that, before taking me to the warden, he’d told me\nsomething about Mother. He had said she’d have to be buried mighty\nquickly because of the heat in these parts, especially down in the plain. “At\nParis they keep the body for three days, sometimes four.” After that he had\nmentioned that he’d spent the best part of his life in Paris, and could never\nmanage to forget it. “Here,” he had said, “things have to go with a rush,\nlike. You’ve hardly time to get used to the idea that someone’s dead, before\nyou’re hauled off to the funeral.” “That’s enough,” his wife had put in.\n“You didn’t ought to say such things to the poor young gentleman.” The old\nfellow had blushed and begun to apologize. I told him it was quite all right.\nAs a matter of fact, I found it rather interesting, what he’d been telling me; I\nhadn’t thought of that before.\n\nNow he went on to say that he’d entered the Home as an ordinary inmate.\nBut he was still quite hale and hearty, and when the keeper’s job fell vacant,\nhe offered to take it on.\n\nI pointed out that, even so, he was really an inmate like the others, but he\nwouldn’t hear of it. He was “an official, like.” I’d been struck before by his\nhabit of saying “they” or, less often, “them old folks,” when referring to\ninmates no older than himself. Still, I could see his point of view. As\ndoorkeeper he had a certain standing, and some authority over the rest of\nthem.\nJust then the nurse returned. Night had fallen very quickly; all of a sudden,\nit seemed, the sky went black above the skylight. The keeper switched on\nthe lamps, and I was almost blinded by the blaze of light.\n\nHe suggested I should go to the refectory for dinner, but I wasn’t hungry.\nThen he proposed bringing me a mug of café au lait. As I am very partial to\ncafé au lait I said, “Thanks,” and a few minutes later he came back with a\ntray. I drank the coffee, and then I wanted a cigarette. But I wasn’t sure if I\nshould smoke, under the circumstances—in Mother’s presence. I thought it\nover; really, it didn’t seem to matter, so I offered the keeper a cigarette, and\nwe both smoked.\n\nAfter a while he started talking again.\n\n“You know, your mother’s friends will be coming soon, to keep vigil with\nyou beside the body. We always have a ‘vigil’ here, when anyone dies. I’d\nbetter go and get some chairs and a pot of black coffee.”\n\nThe glare off the white walls was making my eyes smart, and I asked him if\nhe couldn’t turn off one of the lamps. “Nothing doing,” he said. They’d\narranged the lights like that; either one had them all on or none at all. After\nthat I didn’t pay much more attention to him. He went out, brought some\nchairs, and set them out round the coffin. On one he placed a coffeepot and\nten or a dozen cups. Then he sat down facing me, on the far side of Mother.\nThe nurse was at the other end of the room, with her back to me. I couldn’t\nsee what she was doing, but by the way her arms moved I guessed that she\nwas knitting. I was feeling very comfortable; the coffee had warmed me up,\nand through the open door came scents of flowers and breaths of cool night\nair. I think I dozed off for a while.\n\nI was wakened by an odd rustling in my ears. After having had my eyes\nclosed, I had a feeling that the light had grown even stronger than before.\nThere wasn’t a trace of shadow anywhere, and every object, each curve or\nangle, seemed to score its outline on one’s eyes. The old people, Mother’s\nfriends, were coming in. I counted ten in all, gliding almost soundlessly\nthrough the bleak white glare. None of the chairs creaked when they sat\ndown. Never in my life had I seen anyone so clearly as I saw these people;\nnot a detail of their clothes or features escaped me. And yet I couldn’t hear\nthem, and it was hard to believe they really existed.\n\nNearly all the women wore aprons, and the strings drawn tight round their\nwaists made their big stomachs bulge still more. I’d never yet noticed what\nbig paunches old women usually have. Most of the men, however, were as\nthin as rakes, and they all carried sticks. What struck me most about their\nfaces was that one couldn’t see their eyes, only a dull glow in a sort of nest\nof wrinkles.\n\nOn sitting down, they looked at me, and wagged their heads awkwardly,\ntheir lips sucked in between their toothless gums. I couldn’t decide if they\nwere greeting me and trying to say something, or if it was due to some\ninfirmity of age. I inclined to think that they were greeting me, after their\nfashion, but it had a queer effect, seeing all those old fellows grouped round\nthe keeper, solemnly eying me and dandling their heads from side to side.\nFor a moment I had an absurd impression that they had come to sit in\njudgment on me.\n\nA few minutes later one of the women started weeping. She was in the\nsecond row and I couldn’t see her face because of another woman in front.\nAt regular intervals she emitted a little choking sob; one had a feeling she\nwould never stop. The others didn’t seem to notice. They sat in silence,\nslumped in their chairs, staring at the coffin or at their walking sticks or any\nobject just in front of them, and never took their eyes off it. And still the\nwoman sobbed. I was rather surprised, as I didn’t know who she was. I\nwanted her to stop crying, but dared not speak to her. After a while the\nkeeper bent toward her and whispered in her ear; but she merely shook her\nhead, mumbled something I couldn’t catch, and went on sobbing as steadily\nas before.\n\nThe keeper got up and moved his chair beside mine. At first he kept silent;\nthen, without looking at me, he explained.\n\n“She was devoted to your mother. She says your mother was her only friend\nin the world, and now she’s all alone.”\nI had nothing to say, and the silence lasted quite a while. Presently the\nwoman’s sighs and sobs became less frequent, and, after blowing her nose\nand snuffling for some minutes, she, too, fell silent.\n\nI’d ceased feeling sleepy, but I was very tired and my legs were aching\nbadly. And now I realized that the silence of these people was telling on my\nnerves. The only sound was a rather queer one; it came only now and then,\nand at first I was puzzled by it. However, after listening attentively, I\nguessed what it was; the old men were sucking at the insides of their\ncheeks, and this caused the odd, wheezing noises that had mystified me.\nThey were so much absorbed in their thoughts that they didn’t know what\nthey were up to. I even had an impression that the dead body in their midst\nmeant nothing at all to them. But now I suspect that I was mistaken about\nthis.\n\nWe all drank the coffee, which the keeper handed round. After that, I can’t\nremember much; somehow the night went by. I can recall only one moment;\nI had opened my eyes and I saw the old men sleeping hunched up on their\nchairs, with one exception. Resting his chin on his hands clasped round his\nstick, he was staring hard at me, as if he had been waiting for me to wake.\nThen I fell asleep again. I woke up after a bit, because the ache in my legs\nhad developed into a sort of cramp.\n\nThere was a glimmer of dawn above the skylight. A minute or two later one\nof the old men woke up and coughed repeatedly. He spat into a big check\nhandkerchief, and each time he spat it sounded as if he were retching. This\nwoke the others, and the keeper told them it was time to make a move. They\nall got up at once. Their faces were ashen gray after the long, uneasy vigil.\nTo my surprise each of them shook hands with me, as though this night\ntogether, in which we hadn’t exchanged a word, had created a kind of\nintimacy between us.\n\nI was quite done in. The keeper took me to his room, and I tidied myself up\na bit. He gave me some more “white” coffee, and it seemed to do me good.\nWhen I went out, the sun was up and the sky mottled red above the hills\nbetween Marengo and the sea. A morning breeze was blowing and it had a\npleasant salty tang. There was the promise of a very fine day. I hadn’t been\nin the country for ages, and I caught myself thinking what an agreeable\nwalk I could have had, if it hadn’t been for Mother.\n\nAs it was, I waited in the courtyard, under a plane tree. I sniffed the smells\nof the cool earth and found I wasn’t sleepy any more. Then I thought of the\nother fellows in the office. At this hour they’d be getting up, preparing to go\nto work; for me this was always the worst hour of the day. I went on\nthinking, like this, for ten minutes or so; then the sound of a bell inside the\nbuilding attracted my attention. I could see movements behind the\nwindows; then all was calm again. The sun had risen a little higher and was\nbeginning to warm my feet. The keeper came across the yard and said the\nwarden wished to see me. I went to his office and he got me to sign some\ndocument. I noticed that he was in black, with pin-stripe trousers. He picked\nup the telephone receiver and looked at me.\n\n“The undertaker’s men arrived some moments ago, and they will be going\nto the mortuary to screw down the coffin. Shall I tell them to wait, for you\nto have a last glimpse of your mother?”\n\n“No,” I said.\n\nHe spoke into the receiver, lowering his voice. “That’s all right, Figeac. Tell\nthe men to go there now.”\n\nHe then informed me that he was going to attend the funeral, and I thanked\nhim. Sitting down behind his desk, he crossed his short legs and leaned\nback. Besides the nurse on duty, he told me, he and I would be the only\nmourners at the funeral. It was a rule of the Home that inmates shouldn’t\nattend funerals, though there was no objection to letting some of them sit up\nbeside the coffin, the night before.\n\n“It’s for their own sakes,” he explained, “to spare their feelings. But in this\nparticular instance I’ve given permission to an old friend of your mother to\ncome with us. His name is Thomas Pérez.” The warden smiled. “It’s a\nrather touching little story in its way. He and your mother had become\nalmost inseparable. The other old people used to tease Pérez about having a\nfiancée. ‘When are you going to marry her?’ they’d ask. He’d turn it with a\nlaugh. It was a standing joke, in fact. So, as you can guess, he feels very\nbadly about your mother’s death. I thought I couldn’t decently refuse him\npermission to attend the funeral. But, on our medical officer’s advice, I\nforbade him to sit up beside the body last night.”\n\nFor some time we sat there without speaking. Then the warden got up and\nwent to the window. Presently he said:\n\n“Ah, there’s the padre from Marengo. He’s a bit ahead of time.”\n\nHe warned me that it would take us a good three quarters of an hour,\nwalking to the church, which was in the village. Then we went downstairs.\n\nThe priest was waiting just outside the mortuary door. With him were two\nacolytes, one of whom had a censer. The priest was stooping over him,\nadjusting the length of the silver chain on which it hung. When he saw us\nhe straightened up and said a few words to me, addressing me as, “My son.”\nThen he led the way into the mortuary.\n\nI noticed at once that four men in black were standing behind the coffin and\nthe screws in the lid had now been driven home. At the same moment I\nheard the warden remark that the hearse had arrived, and the priest starting\nhis prayers. Then everybody made a move. Holding a strip of black cloth,\nthe four men approached the coffin, while the priest, the boys, and myself\nfiled out. A lady I hadn’t seen before was standing by the door. “This is\nMonsieur Meursault,” the warden said to her. I didn’t catch her name, but I\ngathered she was a nursing sister attached to the Home. When I was\nintroduced, she bowed, without the trace of a smile on her long, gaunt face.\nWe stood aside from the doorway to let the coffin by; then, following the\nbearers down a corridor, we came to the front entrance, where a hearse was\nwaiting. Oblong, glossy, varnished black all over, it vaguely reminded me\nof the pen trays in the office.\n\nBeside the hearse stood a quaintly dressed little -man, whose duty it was, I\nunderstood, to supervise the funeral, as a sort of master of ceremonies. Near\nhim, looking constrained, almost bashful, was old M. Pérez, my mother’s\nspecial friend. He wore a soft felt hat with a pudding-basin crown and a\nvery wide brim—he whisked it off the moment the coffin emerged from the\ndoorway—trousers that concertina’d on his shoes, a black tie much too\nsmall for his high white double collar. Under a bulbous, pimply nose, his\nlips were trembling. But what caught my attention most was his ears;\npendulous, scarlet ears that showed up like blobs of sealing wax on the\npallor of his cheeks and were framed in wisps of silky white hair.\n\nThe undertaker’s factotum shepherded us to our places, with the priest in\nfront of the hearse, and the four men in black on each side of it. The warden\nand myself came next, and, bringing up the rear, old Pérez and the nurse.\n\nThe sky was already a blaze of light, and the air stoking up rapidly. I felt the\nfirst waves of heat lapping my back, and my dark suit made things worse. I\ncouldn’t imagine why we waited so long for getting under way. Old Pérez,\nwho had put on his hat, took it off again. I had turned slightly in his\ndirection and was looking at him when the warden started telling me more\nabout him. I remember his saying that old Pérez and my mother used often\nto have a longish stroll together in the cool of the evening; sometimes they\nwent as far as the village, accompanied by a nurse, of course.\n\nI looked at the countryside, at the long lines of cypresses sloping up toward\nthe skyline and the hills, the hot red soil dappled with vivid green, and here\nand there a lonely house sharply outlined against the light—and I could\nunderstand Mother’s feelings. Evenings in these parts must be a sort of\nmournful solace. Now, in the full glare of the morning sun, with everything\nshimmering in the heat haze, there was something inhuman, discouraging,\nabout this landscape.\n\nAt last we made a move. Only then I noticed that Pérez had a slight limp.\nThe old chap steadily lost ground as the hearse gained speed. One of the\nmen beside it, too, fell back and drew level with me. I was surprised to see\nhow quickly the sun was climbing up the sky, and just then it struck me that\nfor quite a while the air had been throbbing with the hum of insects and the\nrustle of grass warming up. Sweat was running down my face. As I had no\nhat I tried to fan myself with my handkerchief.\n\nThe undertaker’s man turned to me and said something that I didn’t catch.\nAt that same time he wiped the crown of his head with a handkerchief that\nhe held in his left hand, while with his right he tilted up his hat. I asked him\nwhat he’d said. He pointed upward.\n“Sun’s pretty bad today, ain’t it?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\nAfter a while he asked: “Is it your mother we’re burying?”\n\n“Yes,” I said again.\n\n“What was her age?”\n\n“Well, she was getting on.” As a matter of fact, I didn’t know exactly how\nold she was.\n\nAfter that he kept silent. Looking back, I saw Pérez limping along some\nfifty yards behind. He was swinging his big felt hat at arm’s length, trying\nto make the pace. I also had a look at the warden. He was walking with\ncarefully measured steps, economizing every gesture. Beads of perspiration\nglistened on his forehead, but he didn’t wipe them off.\n\nI had an impression that our little procession was moving slightly faster.\nWherever I looked I saw the same sun-drenched countryside, and the sky\nwas so dazzling that I dared not raise my eyes. Presently we struck a patch\nof freshly tarred road. A shimmer of heat played over it and one’s feet\nsquelched at each step, leaving bright black gashes. In front, the\ncoachman’s glossy black hat looked like a lump of the same sticky\nsubstance, poised above the hearse. It gave one a queer, dreamlike\nimpression, that blue-white glare overhead and all this blackness round one:\nthe sleek black of the hearse, the dull black of the men’s clothes, and the\nsilvery-black gashes in the road. And then there were the smells, smells of\nhot leather and horse dung from the hearse, veined with whiffs of incense\nsmoke. What with these and the hangover from a poor night’s sleep, I found\nmy eyes and thoughts growing blurred.\n\nI looked back again. Pérez seemed very far away now, almost hidden by the\nheat haze; then, abruptly, he disappeared altogether. After puzzling over it\nfor a bit, I guessed that he had turned off the road into the fields. Then I\nnoticed that there was a bend of the road a little way ahead. Obviously\nPérez, who knew the district well, had taken a short cut, so as to catch up\nwith us. He rejoined us soon after we were round the bend; then began to\nlose ground again. He took another short cut and met us again farther on; in\nfact, this happened several times during the next half-hour. But soon I lost\ninterest in his movements; my temples were throbbing and I could hardly\ndrag myself along.\n\nAfter that everything went with a rush; and also with such precision and\nmatter-of-factness that I remember hardly any details. Except that when we\nwere on the outskirts of the village the nurse said something to me. Her\nvoice took me by surprise; it didn’t match her face at all; it was musical and\nslightly tremulous. What she said was: “If you go too slowly there’s the risk\nof a heatstroke. But, if you go too fast, you perspire, and the cold air in the\nchurch gives you a chill.” I saw her point; either way one was in for it.\n\nSome other memories of the funeral have stuck in my mind. The old boy’s\nface, for instance, when he caught up with us for the last time, just outside\nthe village. His eyes were streaming with tears, of exhaustion or distress, or\nboth together. But because of the wrinkles they couldn’t flow down. They\nspread out, crisscrossed, and formed a smooth gloss on the old, worn face.\n\nAnd I can remember the look of the church, the villagers in the street, the\nred geraniums on the graves, Pérez’s fainting fit—he crumpled up like a rag\ndoll—the tawny-red earth pattering on Mother’s coffin, the bits of white\nroots mixed up with it; then more people, voices, the wait outside a café for\nthe bus, the rumble of the engine, and my little thrill of pleasure when we\nentered the first brightly lit streets of Algiers, and I pictured myself going\nstraight to bed and sleeping twelve hours at a stretch.\nII\nON WAKING I understood why my employer had looked rather cross when\nI asked for my two days off; it’s a Saturday today. I hadn’t thought of this at\nthe time; it only struck me when I was getting out of bed. Obviously he had\nseen that it would mean my getting four days’ holiday straight off, and one\ncouldn’t expect him to like that. Still, for one thing, it wasn’t my fault if\nMother was buried yesterday and not today; and then, again, I’d have had\nmy Saturday and Sunday off in any case. But naturally this didn’t prevent\nme from seeing my employer’s point.\n\nGetting up was an effort, as I’d been really exhausted by the previous day’s\nexperiences. While shaving, I wondered how to spend the morning, and\ndecided that a swim would do me good. So I caught the streetcar that goes\ndown to the harbor.\n\nIt was quite like old times; a lot of young people were in the swimming\npool, amongst them Marie Cardona, who used to be a typist at the office. I\nwas rather keen on her in those days, and I fancy she liked me, too. But she\nwas with us so short a time that nothing came of it.\n\nWhile I was helping her to climb on to a raft, I let my hand stray over her\nbreasts. Then she lay flat on the raft, while I trod water. After a moment she\nturned and looked at me. Her hair was over her eyes and she was laughing. I\nclambered up on to the raft, beside her. The air was pleasantly warm, and,\nhalf jokingly, I let my head sink back upon her lap. She didn’t seem to\nmind, so I let it stay there. I had the sky full in my eyes, all blue and gold,\nand I could feel Marie’s stomach rising and falling gently under my head.\nWe must have stayed a good half-hour on the raft, both of us half asleep.\nWhen the sun got too hot she dived off and I followed. I caught up with her,\nput my arm round her waist, and we swam side by side. She was still\nlaughing.\n\nWhile we were drying ourselves on the edge of the swimming pool she\nsaid: “I’m browner than you.” I asked her if she’d come to the movies with\nme that evening. She laughed again and said, “Yes,” if I’d take her to the\ncomedy everybody was talking about, the one with Fernandel in it.\n\nWhen we had dressed, she stared at my black tie and asked if I was in\nmourning. I explained that my mother had died. “When?” she asked, and I\nsaid, “Yesterday.” She made no remark, though I thought she shrank away a\nlittle. I was just going to explain to her that it wasn’t my fault, but I checked\nmyself, as I remembered having said the same thing to my employer, and\nrealizing then it sounded rather foolish. Still, foolish or not, somehow one\ncan’t help feeling a bit guilty, I suppose.\n\nAnyhow, by evening Marie had forgotten all about it. The film was funny in\nparts, but some of it was downright stupid. She pressed her leg against mine\nwhile we were in the picture house, and I was fondling her breast. Toward\nthe end of the show I kissed her, but rather clumsily. Afterward she came\nback with me to my place.\n\nWhen I woke up, Marie had gone. She’d told me her aunt expected her first\nthing in the morning. I remembered it was a Sunday, and that put me off;\nI’ve never cared for Sundays. So I turned my head and lazily sniffed the\nsmell of brine that Marie’s head had left on the pillow. I slept until ten.\nAfter that I stayed in bed until noon, smoking cigarettes. I decided not to\nlunch at Céleste’s restaurant as I usually did; they’d be sure to pester me\nwith questions, and I dislike being questioned. So I fried some eggs and ate\nthem off the pan. I did without bread as there wasn’t any left, and I couldn’t\nbe bothered going down to buy it.\n\nAfter lunch I felt at loose ends and roamed about the little flat. It suited us\nwell enough when Mother was with me, but now that I was by myself it\nwas too large and I’d moved the dining table into my bedroom. That was\nnow the only room I used; it had all the furniture I needed: a brass bedstead,\na dressing table, some cane chairs whose seats had more or less caved in, a\nwardrobe with a tarnished mirror. The rest of the flat was never used, so I\ndidn’t trouble to look after it.\n\nA bit later, for want of anything better to do, I picked up an old newspaper\nthat was lying on the floor and read it. There was an advertisement of\nKruschen Salts and I cut it out and pasted in into an album where I keep\nthings that amuse me in the papers. Then I washed my hands and, as a last\nresource, went out on to the balcony.\n\nMy bedroom overlooks the main street of our district. Though it was a fine\nafternoon, the paving blocks were black and glistening. What few people\nwere about seemed in an absurd hurry. First of all there came a family,\ngoing for their Sunday-afternoon walk; two small boys in sailor suits, with\nshort trousers hardly down to their knees, and looking rather uneasy in their\nSunday best; then a little girl with a big pink bow and black patent-leather\nshoes. Behind them was their mother, an enormously fat woman in a brown\nsilk dress, and their father, a dapper little man, whom I knew by sight. He\nhad a straw hat, a walking stick, and a butterfly tie. Seeing him beside his\nwife, I understood why people said he came of a good family and had\nmarried beneath him.\n\nNext came a group of young fellows, the local “bloods,” with sleek oiled\nhair, red ties, coats cut very tight at the waist, braided pockets, and square-\ntoed shoes. I guessed they were going to one of the big theaters in the center\nof the town. That was why they had started out so early and were hurrying\nto the streetcar stop, laughing and talking at the top of their voices.\n\nAfter they had passed, the street gradually emptied. By this time all the\nmatinees must have begun. Only a few shopkeepers and cats remained\nabout. Above the sycamores bordering the road the sky was cloudless, but\nthe light was soft. The tobacconist on the other side of the street brought a\nchair out on to the pavement in front of his door and sat astride it, resting\nhis arms on the back. The streetcars which a few minutes before had been\ncrowded were now almost empty. In the little café, Chez Pierrot, beside the\ntobacconist’s, the waiter was sweeping up the sawdust in the empty\nrestaurant. A typical Sunday afternoon. ...\n\nI turned my chair round and seated myself like the tobacconist, as it was\nmore comfortable that way. After smoking a couple of cigarettes I went\nback to the room, got a tablet of chocolate, and returned to the window to\neat it. Soon after, the sky clouded over, and I thought a summer storm was\ncoming. However, the clouds gradually lifted. All the same, they had left in\nthe street a sort of threat of rain, which made it darker. I stayed watching the\nsky for quite a while.\nAt five there was a loud clanging of streetcars. They were coming from the\nstadium in our suburb where there had been a football match. Even the back\nplatforms were crowded and people were standing on the steps. Then\nanother streetcar brought back the teams. I knew they were the players by\nthe little suitcase each man carried. They were bawling out their team song,\n“Keep the ball rolling, boys.” One of them looked up at me and shouted,\n“We licked them!” I waved my hand and called back, “Good work!” From\nnow on there was a steady stream of private cars.\n\nThe sky had changed again; a reddish glow was spreading up beyond the\nhousetops. As dusk set in, the street grew more crowded. People were\nreturning from their walks, and I noticed the dapper little man with the fat\nwife amongst the passers-by. Children were whimpering and trailing\nwearily after their parents. After some minutes the local picture houses\ndisgorged their audiences. I noticed that the young fellows coming from\nthem were taking longer strides and gesturing more vigorously than at\nordinary times; doubtless the picture they’d been seeing was of the wild-\nWest variety. Those who had been to the picture houses in the middle of the\ntown came a little later, and looked more sedate, though a few were still\nlaughing. On the whole, however, they seemed languid and exhausted.\nSome of them remained loitering in the street under my window. A group of\ngirls came by, walking arm in arm. The young men under my window\nswerved so as to brush against them, and shouted humorous remarks, which\nmade the girls turn their heads and giggle. I recognized them as girls from\nmy part of the town, and two or three of them, whom I knew, looked up and\nwaved to me.\n\nJust then the street lamps came on, all together, and they made the stars that\nwere beginning to glimmer in the night sky paler still. I felt my eyes getting\ntired, what with the lights and all the movement I’d been watching in the\nstreet. There were little pools of brightness under the lamps, and now and\nthen a streetcar passed, lighting up a girl’s hair, or a smile, or a silver\nbangle.\n\nSoon after this, as the streetcars became fewer and the sky showed velvety\nblack above the trees and lamps, the street grew emptier, almost\nimperceptibly, until a time came when there was nobody to be seen and a\ncat, the first of the evening, crossed, unhurrying, the deserted street.\n\nIt struck me that I’d better see about some dinner. I had been leaning so\nlong on the back of my chair, looking down, that my neck hurt when I\nstraightened myself up. I went down, bought some bread and spaghetti, did\nmy cooking, and ate my meal standing. I’d intended to smoke another\ncigarette at my window, but the night had turned rather chilly and I decided\nagainst it. As I was coming back, after shutting the window, I glanced at the\nmirror and saw reflected in it a corner of my table with my spirit lamp and\nsome bits of bread beside it. It occurred to me that somehow I’d got through\nanother Sunday, that Mother now was buried, and tomorrow I’d be going\nback to work as usual. Really, nothing in my life had changed.\nIII\nI HAD a busy morning in the office. My employer was in a good humor. He\neven inquired if I wasn’t too tired, and followed it up by asking what\nMother’s age was. I thought a bit, then answered, “Round about sixty,” as I\ndidn’t want to make a blunder. At which he looked relieved—why, I can’t\nimagine—and seemed to think that closed the matter.\n\nThere was a pile of bills of lading waiting on my desk, and I had to go\nthrough them all. Before leaving for lunch I washed my hands. I always\nenjoyed doing this at midday. In the evening it was less pleasant, as the\nroller towel, after being used by so many people, was sopping wet. I once\nbrought this to my employer’s notice. It was regrettable, he agreed—but, to\nhis mind, a mere detail. I left the office building a little later than usual, at\nhalf-past twelve, with Emmanuel, who works in the Forwarding\nDepartment. Our building overlooks the sea, and we paused for a moment\non the steps to look at the shipping in the. harbor. The sun was scorching\nhot. Just then a big truck came up, with a din of chains and backfires from\nthe engine, and Emmanuel suggested we should try to jump it. I started to\nrun. The truck was well away, and we had to chase it for quite a distance.\nWhat with the heat and the noise from the engine, I felt half dazed. All I\nwas conscious of was our mad rush along the water front, amongst cranes\nand winches, with dark hulls of ships alongside and masts swaying in the\noffing. I was the first to catch up with the truck. I took a flying jump, landed\nsafely, and helped Emmanuel to scramble in beside me. We were both of us\nout of breath, and the bumps of the truck on the roughly laid cobbles made\nthings worse. Emmanuel chuckled, and panted in my ear, “We’ve made it!”\n\nBy the time we reached Céleste’s restaurant we were dripping with sweat.\nCéleste was at his usual place beside the entrance, with his apron bulging\non his paunch, his white mustache well to the fore. When he saw me he was\nsympathetic and “hoped I wasn’t feeling too badly.” I said, “No,” but I was\nextremely hungry. I ate very quickly and had some coffee to finish up. Then\nI went to my place and took a short nap, as I’d drunk a glass of wine too\nmany.\nWhen I woke I smoked a cigarette before getting off my bed. I was a bit late\nand had to run for the streetcar. The office was stifling, and I was kept hard\nat it all the afternoon. So it came as a relief when we closed down and I was\nstrolling slowly along the wharves in the coolness. The sky was green, and\nit was pleasant to be out-of-doors after the stuffy office. However, I went\nstraight home, as I had to put some potatoes on to boil.\n\nThe hall was dark and, when I was starting up the stairs, I almost bumped\ninto old Salamano, who lived on the same floor as I. As usual, he had his\ndog with him. For eight years the two had been inseparable. Salamano’s\nspaniel is an ugly brute, afflicted with some skin disease—mange, I suspect;\nanyhow, it has lost all its hair and its body is covered with brown scabs.\nPerhaps through living in one small room, cooped up with his dog,\nSalamano has come to resemble it. His towy hair has gone very thin, and he\nhas reddish blotches on his face. And the dog has developed something of\nits master’s queer hunched-up gait; it always has its muzzle stretched far\nforward and its nose to the ground. But, oddly enough, though so much\nalike, they detest each other.\n\nTwice a day, at eleven and six, the old fellow takes his dog for a walk, and\nfor eight years that walk has never varied. You can see them in the rue de\nLyon, the dog pulling his master along as hard as he can, till finally the old\nchap misses a step and nearly falls. Then he beats his dog and calls it\nnames. The dog cowers and lags behind, and it’s his master’s turn to drag\nhim along. Presently the dog forgets, starts tugging at the leash again, gets\nanother hiding and more abuse. Then they halt on the pavement, the pair of\nthem, and glare at each other; the dog with terror and the man with hatred in\nhis eyes. Every time they’re out, this happens. When the dog wants to stop\nat a lamppost, the old boy won’t let him, and drags him on, and the\nwretched spaniel leaves behind him a trail of little drops. But, if he does it\nin the room, it means another hiding.\n\nIt’s been going on like this for eight years, and Céleste always says it’s a\n“crying shame,” and something should be done about it; but really one can’t\nbe sure. When I met him in the hall, Salamano was bawling at his dog,\ncalling him a bastard, a lousy mongrel, and so forth, and the dog was\nwhining. I said, “Good evening,” but the old fellow took no notice and went\non cursing. So I thought I’d ask him what the dog had done. Again, he\ndidn’t answer, but went on shouting, “You bloody cur!” and the rest of it. I\ncouldn’t see very clearly, but he seemed to be fixing something on the dog’s\ncollar. I raised my voice a little. Without looking round, he mumbled in a\nsort of suppressed fury: “He’s always in the way, blast him!” Then he\nstarted up the stairs, but the dog tried to resist and flattened itself out on the\nfloor, so he had to haul it up on the leash, step by step.\n\nJust then another man who lives on my floor came in from the street. The\ngeneral idea hereabouts is that he’s a pimp. But if you ask him what his job\nis, he says he’s a warehouseman. One thing’s sure: he isn’t popular in our\nstreet. Still, he often has a word for me, and drops in sometimes for a short\ntalk in my room, because I listen to him. As a matter of fact, I find what he\nsays quite interesting. So, really I’ve no reason for freezing him off. His\nname is Sintès; Raymond Sintès. He’s short and thick-set, has a nose like a\nboxer’s, and always dresses very sprucely. He, too, once said to me,\nreferring to Salamano, that it was “a damned shame,” and asked me if I\nwasn’t disgusted by the way the old man served his dog. I answered: “No.”\n\nWe went up the stairs together, Sintès and I, and when I was turning in at\nmy door, he said:\n\n“Look here! How about having some grub with me? I’ve a black pudding\nand some wine.”\n\nIt struck me that this would save my having to cook my dinner, so I said,\n“Thanks very much.”\n\nHe, too, has only one room, and a little kitchen without a window. I saw a\npink-and-white plaster angel above his bed, and some photos of sporting\nchampions and naked girls pinned to the opposite wall. The bed hadn’t been\nmade and the room was dirty. He began by lighting a paraffin lamp; then\nfumbled in his pocket and produced a rather grimy bandage, which he\nwrapped round his right hand. I asked him what the trouble was. He told me\nhe’d been having a roughhouse with a fellow who’d annoyed him.\n\n“I’m not one who looks for trouble,” he explained, “only I’m a bit short-\ntempered. That fellow said to me, challenging-like, ‘Come down off that\nstreetcar, if you’re a man.’ I says, ‘You keep quiet, I ain’t done nothing to\nyou.’ Then he said I hadn’t any guts. Well, that settled it. I got down off the\nstreetcar and I said to him, ‘You better keep your mouth shut, or I’ll shut it\nfor you.’ ‘I’d like to see you try!’ says he. Then I gave him one across the\nface, and laid him out good and proper. After a bit I started to help him get\nup, but all he did was to kick at me from where he lay. So I gave him one\nwith my knee and a couple more swipes. He was bleeding like a pig when\nI’d done with him. I asked him if he’d had enough, and he said, ‘Yes.’ ”\n\nSintès was busy fixing his bandage while he talked, and I was sitting on the\nbed.\n\n“So you see,” he said, “it wasn’t my fault; he was asking for it, wasn’t he?”\n\nI nodded, and he added:\n\n“As a matter of fact, I rather want to ask your advice about something; it’s\nconnected with this business. You’ve knocked about the world a bit, and I\ndaresay you can help me. And then I’ll be your pal for life; I never forget\nanyone who does me a good turn.”\n\nWhen I made no comment, he asked me if I’d like us to be pals. I replied\nthat I had no objection, and that appeared to satisfy him. He got out the\nblack pudding, cooked it in a frying pan, then laid the table, putting out two\nbottles of wine. While he was doing this he didn’t speak.\n\nWe started dinner, and then he began telling me the whole story, hesitating a\nbit at first.\n\n“There’s a girl behind it—as usual. We slept together pretty regular. I was\nkeeping her, as a matter of fact, and she cost me a tidy sum. That fellow I\nknocked down is her brother.”\n\nNoticing that I said nothing, he added that he knew what the neighbors said\nabout him, but it was a filthy lie. He had his principles like everybody else,\nand a job in a warehouse.\n“Well,” he said, “to go on with my story ... I found out one day that she was\nletting me down.” He gave her enough money to keep her going, without\nextravagance, though; he paid the rent of her room and twenty francs a day\nfor food. “Three hundred francs for rent, and six hundred for her grub, with\na little present thrown in now and then, a pair of stockings or whatnot. Say,\na thousand francs a month. But that wasn’t enough for my fine lady; she\nwas always grumbling that she couldn’t make both ends meet with what I\ngave her. So one day I says to her, ‘Look here, why not get a job for a few\nhours a day? That’d make things easier for me, too. I bought you a new\ndress this month, I pay your rent and give you twenty francs a day. But you\ngo and waste your money at the café with a pack of girls. You give them\ncoffee and sugar. And, of course, the money comes out of my pocket. I treat\nyou on the square, and that’s how you pay me back.’ But she wouldn’t hear\nof working, though she kept on saying she couldn’t make do with what I\ngave her. And then one day I found out she was doing me dirt.”\n\nHe went on to explain that he’d found a lottery ticket in her bag, and, when\nhe asked where the money’d come from to buy it, she wouldn’t tell him.\nThen, another time, he’d found a pawn ticket for two bracelets that he’d\nnever set eyes on.\n\n“So I knew there was dirty work going on, and I told her I’d have nothing\nmore to do with her. But, first, I gave her a good hiding, and I told her some\nhome truths. I said that there was only one thing interested her and that was\ngetting into bed with men whenever she’d the chance. And I warned her\nstraight, ‘You’ll be sorry one day, my girl, and wish you’d got me back. All\nthe girls in the street, they’re jealous of your luck in having me to keep\nyou.’ ”\n\nHe’d beaten her till the blood came. Before that he’d never beaten her.\n“Well, not hard, anyhow; only affectionately-like. She’d howl a bit, and I\nhad to shut the window. Then, of course, it ended as per usual. But this time\nI’m done with her. Only, to my mind, I ain’t punished her enough. See what\nI mean?”\n\nHe explained that it was about this he wanted my advice. The lamp was\nsmoking, and he stopped pacing up and down the room, to lower the wick. I\njust listened, without speaking. I’d had a whole bottle of wine to myself and\nmy head was buzzing. As I’d used up my cigarettes I was smoking\nRaymond’s. Some late streetcars passed, and the last noises of the street\ndied off with them. Raymond went on talking. What bored him was that he\nhad “a sort of lech on her” as he called it. But he was quite determined to\nteach her a lesson.\n\nHis first idea, he said, had been to take her to a hotel, and then call in the\nspecial police. He’d persuade them to put her on the register as a “common\nprostitute,” and that would make her wild. Then he’d looked up some\nfriends of his in the underworld, fellows who kept tarts for what they could\nmake out of them, but they had practically nothing to suggest. Still, as he\npointed out, that sort of thing should have been right up their street; what’s\nthe good of being in that line if you don’t know how to treat a girl who’s let\nyou down? When he told them that, they suggested he should “brand” her.\nBut that wasn’t what he wanted, either. It would need a lot of thinking out.\n... But, first, he’d like to ask me something. Before he asked it, though, he’d\nlike to have my opinion of the story he’d been telling, in a general way.\n\nI said I hadn’t any, but I’d found it interesting.\n\nDid I think she really had done him dirt?\n\nI had to admit it looked like that. Then he asked me if I didn’t think she\nshould be punished and what I’d do if I were in his shoes. I told him one\ncould never be quite sure how to act in such cases, but I quite understood\nhis wanting her to suffer for it.\n\nI drank some more wine, while Raymond lit another cigarette and began\nexplaining what he proposed to do. He wanted to write her a letter, “a real\nstinker, that’ll get her on the raw,” and at the same time make her repent of\nwhat she’d done. Then, when she came back, he’d go to bed with her and,\njust when she was “properly primed up,” he’d spit in her face and throw her\nout of the room. I agreed it wasn’t a bad plan; it would punish her, all right.\n\nBut, Raymond told me, he didn’t feel up to writing the kind of letter that\nwas needed, and that was where I could help. When I didn’t say anything,\nhe asked me if I’d mind doing it right away, and I said, “No,” I’d have a\nshot at it.\nHe drank off a glass of wine and stood up. Then he pushed aside the plates\nand the bit of cold pudding that was left, to make room on the table. After\ncarefully wiping the oilcloth, he got a sheet of squared paper from the\ndrawer of his bedside table; after that, an envelope, a small red wooden\npenholder, and a square inkpot with purple ink in it. The moment he\nmentioned the girl’s name I knew she was a Moor.\n\nI wrote the letter. I didn’t take much trouble over it, but I wanted to satisfy\nRaymond, as I’d no reason not to satisfy him. Then I read out what I’d\nwritten. Puffing at his cigarette, he listened, nodding now and then. “Read it\nagain, please,” he said. He seemed delighted. “That’s the stuff,” he\nchuckled. “I could tell you was a brainy sort, old boy, and you know what’s\nwhat.”\n\nAt first I hardly noticed that “old boy.” It came back to me when he slapped\nme on the shoulder and said, “So now we’re pals, ain’t we?” I kept silence\nand he said it again. I didn’t care one way or the other, but as he seemed so\nset on it, I nodded and said, “Yes.”\n\nHe put the letter into the envelope and we finished off the wine. Then both\nof us smoked for some minutes, without speaking. The street was quite\nquiet, except when now and again a car passed. Finally, I remarked that it\nwas getting late, and Raymond agreed. “Time’s gone mighty fast this\nevening,” he added, and in a way that was true. I wanted to be in bed, only\nit was such an effort making a move. I must have looked tired, for Raymond\nsaid to me, “You mustn’t let things get you down.” At first I didn’t catch his\nmeaning. Then he explained that he had heard of my mother’s death;\nanyhow, he said, that was something bound to happen one day or another. I\nappreciated that, and told him so.\n\nWhen I rose, Raymond shook hands very warmly, remarking that men\nalways understood each other. After closing the door behind me I lingered\nfor some moments on the landing. The whole building was as quiet as the\ngrave, a dank, dark smell rising from the well hole of the stairs. I could hear\nnothing but the blood throbbing in my ears, and for a while I stood still,\nlistening to it. Then the dog began to moan in old Salamano’s room, and\nthrough the sleep-bound house the little plaintive sound rose slowly, like a\nflower growing out of the silence and the darkness.\nIV\nI HAD a busy time in the office throughout the week. Raymond dropped in\nonce to tell me he’d sent off the letter. I went to the pictures twice with\nEmmanuel, who doesn’t always understand what’s happening on the screen\nand asks me to explain it. Yesterday was Saturday, and Marie came as we’d\narranged. She had a very pretty dress, with red and white stripes, and\nleather sandals, and I couldn’t take my eyes off her. One could see the\noutline of her firm little breasts, and her sun-tanned face was like a velvety\nbrown flower. We took the bus and went to a beach I know, some miles out\nof Algiers. It’s just a strip of sand between two rocky spurs, with a line of\nrushes at the back, along the tide line. At four o’clock the sun wasn’t too\nhot, but the water was pleasantly tepid, and small, languid ripples were\ncreeping up the sand.\n\nMarie taught me a new game. The idea was, while one swam, to suck in the\nspray off the waves and, when one’s mouth was full of foam, to lie on one’s\nback and spout it out against the sky. It made a sort of frothy haze that\nmelted into the air or fell back in a warm shower on one’s cheeks. But very\nsoon my mouth was smarting with all the salt I’d drawn in; then Marie\ncame up and hugged me in the water, and pressed her mouth to mine. Her\ntongue cooled my lips, and we let the waves roll us about for a minute or\ntwo before swimming back to the beach.\n\nWhen we had finished dressing, Marie looked hard at me. Her eyes were\nsparkling. I kissed her; after that neither of us spoke for quite a while. I\npressed her to my side as we scrambled up the foreshore. Both of us were in\na hurry to catch the bus, get back to my place, and tumble on to the bed. I’d\nleft my window open, and it was pleasant to feel the cool night air flowing\nover our sunburned bodies.\n\nMarie said she was free next morning, so I proposed she should have\nluncheon with me. She agreed, and I went down to buy some meat. On my\nway back I heard a woman’s voice in Raymond’s room. A little later old\nSalamano started grumbling at his dog and presently there was a sound of\nboots and paws on the wooden stairs; then, “Filthy brute! Get on, you cur!”\nand the two of them went out into the street. I told Marie about the old\nman’s habits, and it made her laugh. She was wearing one of my pajama\nsuits, and had the sleeves rolled up. When she laughed I wanted her again.\nA moment later she asked me if I loved her. I said that sort of question had\nno meaning, really; but I supposed I didn’t. She looked sad for a bit, but\nwhen we were getting our lunch ready she brightened up and started\nlaughing, and when she laughs I always want to kiss her. It was just then\nthat the row started in Raymond’s room.\n\nFirst we heard a woman saying something in a high-pitched voice; then\nRaymond bawling at her, “You let me down, you bitch! I’ll learn you to let\nme down!” There came some thuds, then a piercing scream—it made one’s\nblood run cold—and in a moment there was a crowd of people on the\nlanding. Marie and I went out to see. The woman was still screaming and\nRaymond still knocking her about. Marie said, wasn’t it horrible! I didn’t\nanswer anything. Then she asked me to go and fetch a policeman, but I told\nher I didn’t like policemen. However, one turned up presently; the lodger on\nthe second floor, a plumber, came up, with him. When he banged on the\ndoor the noise stopped inside the room. He knocked again, and, after a\nmoment, the woman started crying, and Raymond opened the door. He had\na cigarette dangling from his underlip and a rather sickly smile.\n\n“Your name?” Raymond gave his name. “Take that cigarette out of your\nmouth when you’re talking to me,” the policeman said gruffly. Raymond\nhesitated, glanced at me, and kept the cigarette in his mouth. The policeman\npromptly swung his arm and gave him a good hard smack on the left cheek.\nThe cigarette shot from his lips and dropped a yard away. Raymond made a\nwry face, but said nothing for a moment. Then in a humble tone he asked if\nhe mightn’t pick up his cigarette.\n\nThe officer said, “Yes,” and added: “But don’t you forget next time that we\ndon’t stand for any nonsense, not from guys like you.”\n\nMeanwhile the girl went on sobbing and repeating: “He hit me, the coward.\nHe’s a pimp.”\n\n“Excuse me, officer,” Raymond put in, “but is that in order, calling a man a\npimp in the presence of witnesses?”\n\nThe policeman told him to shut his trap.\nRaymond then turned to the girl. “Don’t you worry, my pet. We’ll meet\nagain.”\n\n“That’s enough,” the policeman said, and told the girl to go away. Raymond\nwas to stay in his room till summoned to the police station. “You ought to\nbe ashamed of yourself,” the policeman added, “getting so tight you can’t\nstand steady. Why, you’re shaking all over!”\n\n“I’m not tight,” Raymond explained. “Only when I see you standing there\nand looking at me, I can’t help trembling. That’s only natural.”\n\nThen he closed his door, and we all went away. Marie and I finished getting\nour lunch ready. But she hadn’t any appetite, and I ate nearly all. She left at\none, and then I had a nap.\n\nToward three there was a knock at my door and Raymond came in. He sat\ndown on the edge of my bed and for a minute or two said nothing. I asked\nhim how it had gone off. He said it had all gone quite smoothly at first, as\nper program; only then she’d slapped his face and he’d seen red, and started\nthrashing her. As for what happened after that, he needn’t tell me, as I was\nthere.\n\n“Well,” I said, “you taught her a lesson, all right, and that’s what you\nwanted, isn’t it?”\n\nHe agreed, and pointed out that whatever the police did, that wouldn’t\nchange the fact she’d had her punishment. As for the police, he knew\nexactly how to handle them. But he’d like to know if I’d expected him to\nreturn the blow when the policeman hit him.\n\nI told him I hadn’t expected anything whatsoever and, anyhow, I had no use\nfor the police. Raymond seemed pleased and asked if I’d like to come out\nfor a stroll with him. I got up from the bed and started brushing my hair.\nThen Raymond said that what he really wanted was for me to act as his\nwitness. I told him I had no objection; only I didn’t know what he expected\nme to say.\n“It’s quite simple,” he replied. “You’ve only got to tell them that the girl\nhad let me down.”\n\nSo I agreed to be his witness.\n\nWe went out together, and Raymond stood me a brandy in a café. Then we\nhad a game of billiards; it was a close game and I lost by only a few points.\nAfter that he proposed going to a brothel, but I refused; I didn’t feel like it.\nAs we were walking slowly back he told me how pleased he was at having\npaid out his mistress so satisfactorily. He made himself extremely amiable\nto me, and I quite enjoyed our walk.\n\nWhen we were nearly home I saw old Salamano on the doorstep; he seemed\nvery excited. I noticed that his dog wasn’t with him. He was turning like a\nteetotum, looking in all directions, and sometimes peering into the darkness\nof the hall with his little bloodshot eyes. Then he’d mutter something to\nhimself and start gazing up and down the street again.\n\nRaymond asked him what was wrong, but he didn’t answer at once. Then I\nheard him grunt, “The bastard! The filthy cur!” When I asked him where\nhis dog was, he scowled at me and snapped out, “Gone!” A moment later,\nall of a sudden, he launched out into it.\n\n“I’d taken him to the Parade Ground as usual. There was a fair on, and you\ncould hardly move for the crowd. I stopped at one of the booths to look at\nthe Handcuff King. When I turned to go, the dog was gone. I’d been\nmeaning to get a smaller collar, but I never thought the brute could slip it\nand get away like that.”\n\nRaymond assured him the dog would find its way home, and told him\nstories of dogs that had traveled miles and miles to get back to their\nmasters. But this seemed to make the old fellow even more worried than\nbefore.\n\n“Don’t you understand, they’ll do away with him; the police, I mean. It’s\nnot likely anyone will take him in and look after him; with all those scabs\nhe puts everybody off.”\nI told him that there was a pound at the police station, where stray dogs are\ntaken. His dog was certain to be there and he could get it back on payment\nof a small charge. He asked me how much the charge was, but there I\ncouldn’t help him. Then he flew into a rage again.\n\n“Is it likely I’d give money for a mutt like that? No damned fear! They can\nkill him, for all I care.” And he went on calling his dog the usual names.\n\nRaymond gave a laugh and turned into the hall. I followed him upstairs, and\nwe parted on the landing. A minute or two later I heard Salamano’s\nfootsteps and a knock on my door.\n\nWhen I opened it, he halted for a moment in the doorway.\n\n“Excuse me ... I hope I’m not disturbing you.”\n\nI asked him in, but he shook his head. He was staring at his toe caps, and\nthe gnarled old hands were trembling. Without meeting my eyes, he started\ntalking.\n\n“They won’t really take him from me, will they, Monsieur Meursault?\nSurely they wouldn’t do a thing like that. If they do—I don’t know what\nwill become of me.”\n\nI told him that, so far as I knew, they kept stray dogs in the pound for three\ndays, waiting for their owners to call for them. After that they disposed of\nthe dogs as they thought fit.\n\nHe stared at me in silence for a moment, then said, “Good evening.” After\nthat I heard him pacing up and down his room for quite a while. Then his\nbed creaked. Through the wall there came to me a little wheezing sound,\nand I guessed that he was weeping. For some reason, I don’t know what, I\nbegan thinking of Mother. But I had to get up early next day; so, as I wasn’t\nfeeling hungry, I did without supper, and went straight to bed.\n\nV\nRAYMOND rang me up at the office. He said that a friend of his—to\nwhom he’d spoken about me—invited me to spend next Sunday at his little\nseaside bungalow just outside Algiers. I told him I’d have been delighted;\nonly I had promised to spend Sunday with a girl. Raymond promptly\nreplied that she could come, too. In fact, his friend’s wife would be very\npleased not to be the only woman in a party of men.\n\nI’d have liked to hang up at once, as my employer doesn’t approve of my\nusing the office phone for private calls. But Raymond asked me to hold on;\nhe had something else to tell me, and that was why he’d rung me up, though\nhe could have waited till the evening to pass on the invitation.\n\n“It’s like this,” he said. “I’ve been shadowed all the morning by some\nArabs. One of them’s the brother of that girl I had the row with. If you see\nhim hanging round the house when you come back, pass me the word.”\n\nI promised to do so.\n\nJust then my employer sent for me. For a moment I felt uneasy, as I\nexpected he was going to tell me to stick to my work and not waste time\nchattering with friends over the phone. However, it was nothing of the kind.\nHe wanted to discuss a project he had in view, though so far he’d come to\nno decision. It was to open a branch at Paris, so as to be able to deal with\nthe big companies on the spot, without postal delays, and he wanted to\nknow if I’d like a post there.\n\n“You’re a young man,” he said, “and I’m pretty sure you’d enjoy living in\nParis. And, of course, you could travel about France for some months in the\nyear.”\n\nI told him I was quite prepared to go; but really I didn’t care much one way\nor the other.\n\nHe then asked if a “change of life,” as he called it, didn’t appeal to me, and\nI answered that one never changed his way of life; one life was as good as\nanother, and my present one suited me quite well.\n\nAt this he looked rather hurt, and told me that I always shilly-shallied, and\nthat I lacked ambition—a grave defect, to his mind, when one was in\nbusiness.\nI returned to my work. I’d have preferred not to vex him, but I saw no\nreason for “changing my life.” By and large it wasn’t an unpleasant one. As\na student I’d had plenty of ambition of the kind he meant. But, when I had\nto drop my studies, I very soon realized all that was pretty futile.\n\nMarie came that evening and asked me if I’d marry her. I said I didn’t mind;\nif she was keen on it, we’d get married.\n\nThen she asked me again if I loved her. I replied, much as before, that her\nquestion meant nothing or next to nothing—but I supposed I didn’t.\n\n“If that’s how you feel,” she said, “why marry me?”\n\nI explained that it had no importance really, but, if it would give her\npleasure, we could get married right away. I pointed out that, anyhow, the\nsuggestion came from her; as for me, I’d merely said, “Yes.”\n\nThen she remarked that marriage was a serious matter.\n\nTo which I answered: “No.”\n\nShe kept silent after that, staring at me in a curious way. Then she asked:\n\n“Suppose another girl had asked you to marry her—I mean, a girl you liked\nin the same way as you like me—would you have said ‘Yes’ to her, too?”\n\n“Naturally.”\n\nThen she said she wondered if she really loved me or not. I, of course,\ncouldn’t enlighten her as to that. And, after another silence, she murmured\nsomething about my being “a queer fellow.” “And I daresay that’s why I\nlove you,” she added. “But maybe that’s why one day I’ll come to hate\nyou.”\n\nTo which I had nothing to say, so I said nothing.\n\nShe thought for a bit, then started smiling and, taking my arm, repeated that\nshe was in earnest; she really wanted to marry me.\n“All right,” I answered. “We’ll get married whenever you like.” I then\nmentioned the proposal made by my employer, and Marie said she’d love to\ngo to Paris.\n\nWhen I told her I’d lived in Paris for a while, she asked me what it was like.\n\n“A dingy sort of town, to my mind. Masses of pigeons and dark courtyards.\nAnd the people have washed-out, white faces.”\n\nThen we went for a walk all the way across the town by the main streets.\nThe women were good-lookers, and I asked Marie if she, too, noticed this.\nShe said, “Yes,” and that she saw what I meant. After that we said nothing\nfor some minutes. However, as I didn’t want her to leave me, I suggested\nwe should dine together at Céleste’s. She’d have loved to dine with me, she\nsaid, only she was booked up for the evening. We were near my place, and I\nsaid, “Au revoir, then.”\n\nShe looked me in the eyes.\n\n“Don’t you want to know what I’m doing this evening?”\n\nI did want to know, but I hadn’t thought of asking her, and I guessed she\nwas making a grievance of it. I must have looked embarrassed, for suddenly\nshe started laughing and bent toward me, pouting her lips for a kiss.\n\nI went by myself to Céleste’s. When I had just started my dinner an odd-\nlooking little woman came in and asked if she might sit at my table. Of\ncourse she might. She had a chubby face like a ripe apple, bright eyes, and\nmoved in a curiously jerky way, as if she were on wires. After taking off her\nclosefitting jacket she sat down and started studying the bill of fare with a\nsort of rapt attention. Then she called Céleste and gave her order, very fast\nbut quite distinctly; one didn’t lose a word. While waiting for the hors\nd’oeuvre she opened her bag, took out a slip of paper and a pencil, and\nadded up the bill in advance. Diving into her bag again, she produced a\npurse and took from it the exact sum, plus a small tip, and placed it on the\ncloth in front of her.\nJust then the waiter brought the hors d’oeuvre, which she proceeded to wolf\ndown voraciously. While waiting for the next course, she produced another\npencil, this time a blue one, from her bag, and the radio magazine for the\ncoming week, and started making ticks against almost all the items of the\ndaily programs. There were a dozen pages in the magazine, and she\ncontinued studying them closely throughout the meal. When I’d finished\nmine she was still ticking off items with the same meticulous attention.\nThen she rose, put on her jacket again with the same abrupt, robot-like\ngestures, and walked briskly out of the restaurant.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I followed her for a short distance. Keeping on\nthe curb of the pavement, she walked straight ahead, never swerving or\nlooking back, and it was extraordinary how fast she covered the ground,\nconsidering her smallness. In fact, the pace was too much for me, and I\nsoon lost sight of her and turned back homeward. For a moment the “little\nrobot” (as I thought of her) had much impressed me, but I soon forgot about\nher.\n\nAs I was turning in at my door I ran into old Salamano. I asked him into my\nroom, and he informed me that his dog was definitely lost. He’d been to the\npound to inquire, but it wasn’t there, and the staff told him it had probably\nbeen run over. When he asked them whether it was any use inquiring about\nit at the police station, they said the police had more important things to\nattend to than keeping records of stray dogs run over in the streets. I\nsuggested he should get another dog, but, reasonably enough, he pointed\nout that he’d become used to this one, and it wouldn’t be the same thing.\n\nI was seated on my bed, with my legs up, and Salamano on a chair beside\nthe table, facing me, his hands spread on his knees. He had kept on his\nbattered felt hat and was mumbling away behind his draggled yellowish\nmustache. I found him rather boring, but I had nothing to do and didn’t feel\nsleepy. So, to keep the conversation going, I asked some questions about his\ndog—how long he had had it and so forth. He told me he had got it soon\nafter his wife’s death. He’d married rather late in life. When a young man,\nhe wanted to go on the stage; during his military service he’d often played\nin the regimental theatricals and acted rather well, so everybody said.\nHowever, finally, he had taken a job in the railway, and he didn’t regret it,\nas now he had a small pension. He and his wife had never hit it off very\nwell, but they’d got used to each other, and when she died he felt lonely.\nOne of his mates on the railway whose bitch had just had pups had offered\nhim one, and he had taken it, as a companion. He’d had to feed it from the\nbottle at first. But, as a dog’s life is shorter than a man’s, they’d grown old\ntogether, so to speak.\n\n“He was a cantankerous brute,” Salamano said. “Now and then we had\nsome proper set-tos, he and I. But he was a good mutt all the same.”\n\nI said he looked well bred, and that evidently pleased the old man.\n\n“Ah, but you should have seen him before his illness!” he said. “He had a\nwonderful coat; in fact, that was his best point, really. I tried hard to cure\nhim; every mortal night after he got that skin disease I rubbed an ointment\nin. But his real trouble was old age, and there’s no curing that.”\n\nJust then I yawned, and the old man said he’d better make a move. I told\nhim he could stay, and that I was sorry about what had happened to his dog.\nHe thanked me, and mentioned that my mother had been very fond of his\ndog. He referred to her as “your poor mother,” and was afraid I must be\nfeeling her death terribly. When I said nothing he added hastily and with a\nrather embarrassed air that some of the people in the street said nasty things\nabout me because I’d sent my mother to the Home. But he, of course, knew\nbetter; he knew how devoted to my mother I had always been.\n\nI answered—why, I still don’t know—that it surprised me to learn I’d\nproduced such a bad impression. As I couldn’t afford to keep her here, it\nseemed the obvious thing to do, to send her to a home. “In any case,” I\nadded, “for years she’d never had a word to say to me, and I could see she\nwas moping, with no one to talk to.”\n\n“Yes,” he said, “and at a home one makes friends, anyhow.”\n\nHe got up, saying it was high time for him to be in bed, and added that life\nwas going to be a bit of a problem for him, under the new conditions. For\nthe first time since I’d known him he held out his hand to me—rather shyly,\nI thought—and I could feel the scales on his skin. Just as he was going out\nof the door, he turned and, smiling a little, said:\n\n“Let’s hope the dogs won’t bark again tonight. I always think it’s mine I\nhear. ...”\n\nVI\nIT was an effort waking up that Sunday morning; Marie had to jog my\nshoulders and shout my name. As we wanted to get into the water early, we\ndidn’t trouble about breakfast. My head was aching slightly and my first\ncigarette had a bitter taste. Marie told me I looked like a mourner at a\nfuneral, and I certainly did feel very limp. She was wearing a white dress\nand had her hair loose. I told her she looked quite ravishing like that, and\nshe laughed happily.\n\nOn our way out we banged on Raymond’s door, and he shouted that he’d be\nwith us in a jiffy. We went down to the street and, because of my being\nrather under the weather and our having kept the blind down in my room,\nthe glare of the morning sun hit me in the eyes like a clenched fist.\n\nMarie, however, was almost dancing with delight, and kept repeating,\n“What a heavenly day!” After a few minutes I was feeling better, and\nnoticed that I was hungry. I mentioned this to Marie, but she paid no\nattention. She was carrying an oilcloth bag in which she had stowed our\nbathing kit and a towel. Presently we heard Raymond shutting his door. He\nwas wearing blue trousers, a short-sleeved white shirt, and a straw hat. I\nnoticed that his forearms were rather hairy, but the skin was very white\nbeneath. The straw hat made Marie giggle. Personally, I was rather put off\nby his getup. He seemed in high spirits and was whistling as he came down\nthe stairs. He greeted me with, “Hello, old boy!” and addressed Marie as\n“Mademoiselle.”\n\nOn the previous evening we had visited the police station, where I gave\nevidence for Raymond—about the girl’s having been false to him. So they\nlet him off with a warning. They didn’t check my statement.\n\nAfter some talk on the doorstep we decided to take the bus. The beach was\nwithin easy walking distance, but the sooner we got there the better. Just as\nwe were starting for the bus stop, Raymond plucked my sleeve and told me\nto look across the street. I saw some Arabs lounging against the\ntobacconist’s window. They were staring at us silently, in the special way\nthese people have—as if we were blocks of stone or dead trees. Raymond\nwhispered that the second Arab from the left was “his man,” and I thought\nhe looked rather worried However, he assured me that all that was ancient\nhistory. Marie, who hadn’t followed his remarks, asked, “What is it?”\n\nI explained that those Arabs across the way had a grudge against Raymond.\nShe insisted on our going at once. Then Raymond laughed, and squared his\nshoulders. The young lady was quite right, he said. There was no point in\nhanging about here. Halfway to the bus stop he glanced back over his\nshoulder and said the Arabs weren’t following. I, too, looked back. They\nwere exactly as before, gazing in the same vague way at the spot where we\nhad been.\n\nWhen we were in the bus, Raymond, who now seemed quite at ease, kept\nmaking jokes to amuse Marie. I could see he was attracted by her, but she\nhad hardly a word for him. Now and again she would catch my eye and\nsmile.\n\nWe alighted just outside Algiers. The beach is not far from the bus stop; one\nhas only to cross a patch of highland, a sort of plateau, which overlooks the\nsea and shelves down steeply to the sands. The ground here was covered\nwith yellowish pebbles and wild lilies that showed snow-white against the\nblue of the sky, which had already the hard, metallic glint it gets on very hot\ndays. Marie amused herself swishing her bag against the flowers and\nsending the petals showering in all directions. Then we walked between two\nrows of little houses with wooden balconies and green or white palings.\nSome of them were half hidden in clumps of tamarisks; others rose naked\nfrom the stony plateau. Before we came to the end of it, the sea was in full\nview; it lay smooth as a mirror, and in the distance a big headland jutted out\nover its black reflection. Through the still air came the faint buzz of a motor\nengine and we saw a fishing boat very far out, gliding almost imperceptibly\nacross the dazzling smoothness.\n\nMarie picked some rock irises. Going down the steep path leading to the\nsea, we saw some bathers already on the sands.\nRaymond’s friend owned a small wooden bungalow at the near end of the\nbeach. Its back rested against the cliffside, while the front stood on piles,\nwhich the water was already lapping. Raymond introduced us to his friend,\nwhose name was Masson. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and thick-set; his\nwife was a plump, cheerful little woman who spoke with a Paris accent.\n\nMasson promptly told us to make ourselves at home. He had gone out\nfishing, he said, first thing in the morning, and there would be fried fish for\nlunch. I congratulated him on his little bungalow, and he said he always\nspent his week ends and holidays here. “With the missus, needless to say,”\nhe added. I glanced at her, and noticed that she and Marie seemed to be\ngetting on well together; laughing and chattering away. For the first time,\nperhaps, I seriously considered the possibility of my marrying her.\n\nMasson wanted to have a swim at once, but his wife and Raymond were\ndisinclined to move. So only the three of us, Marie, Masson, and myself,\nwent down to the beach. Marie promptly plunged in, but Masson and I\nwaited for a bit. He was rather slow of speech and had, I noticed, a habit of\nsaying “and what’s more” between his phrases—even when the second\nadded nothing really to the first. Talking of Marie, he said: “She’s an\nawfully pretty girl, and what’s more, charming.”\n\nBut I soon ceased paying attention to this trick of his; I was basking in the\nsunlight, which, I noticed, was making me feel much better. The sand was\nbeginning to stoke up underfoot and, though I was eager for a dip, I\npostponed it for a minute or two more. At last I said to Masson: “Shall we\ngo in now?” and plunged. Masson walked in gingerly and only began to\nswim when he was out of his depth. He swam hand over hand and made\nslow headway, so I left him behind and caught up with Marie. The water\nwas cold and I felt all the better for it. We swam a long way out, Marie and\nI, side by side, and it was pleasant feeling how our movements matched,\nhers and mine, and how we were both in the same mood, enjoying every\nmoment.\n\nOnce we were out in the open, we lay on our backs and, as I gazed up at the\nsky, I could feel the sun drawing up the film of salt water on my lips and\ncheeks. We saw Masson swim back to the beach and slump down on the\nsand under the sun. In the distance he looked enormous, like a stranded\nwhale. Then Marie proposed that we should swim tandem. She went ahead\nand I put my arms round her waist, from behind, and while she drew me\nforward with her arm strokes, I kicked out behind to help us on.\n\nThat sound of little splashes had been in my ears for so long that I began to\nfeel I’d had enough of it. So I let go of Marie and swam back at an easy\npace, taking long, deep breaths. When I made the beach I stretched myself\nbelly downward beside Masson, resting my face on the sand. I told him “it\nwas fine” here, and he agreed. Presently Marie came back. I raised my head\nto watch her approach. She was glistening with brine and holding her hair\nback. Then she lay down beside me, and what with the combined warmth of\nour bodies and the sun, I felt myself dropping off to sleep.\n\nAfter a while Marie tugged my arm. and said Masson had gone to his place;\nit must be nearly lunchtime. I rose at once, as I was feeling hungry, but\nMarie told me I hadn’t kissed her once since the early morning. That was so\n—though I’d wanted to, several times. “Let’s go into the water again,” she\nsaid, and we ran into the sea and lay flat amongst the ripples for a moment.\nThen we swam a few strokes, and when we were almost out of our depth\nshe flung her arms round me and hugged me. I felt her legs twining round\nmine, and my senses tingled.\n\nWhen we got back, Masson was on the steps of his bungalow, shouting to\nus to come. I told him I was ravenously hungry, and he promptly turned to\nhis wife and said he’d taken quite a fancy to me. The bread was excellent,\nand I had my full share of the fish. Then came some steak and potato chips.\nNone of us spoke while eating. Masson drank a lot of wine and kept\nrefilling my glass the moment it was empty. By the time coffee was handed\nround I was feeling slightly muzzy, and I started smoking one cigarette after\nanother. Masson, Raymond, and I discussed a plan of spending the whole of\nAugust on the beach together, sharing expenses.\n\nSuddenly Marie exclaimed: “I say! Do you know the time? It’s only half-\npast eleven!”\n\nWe were all surprised at that, and Masson remarked that we’d had a very\nearly lunch, but really lunch was a movable feast, you had it when you felt\nlike it.\nThis set Marie laughing, I don’t know why. I suspect she’d drunk a bit too\nmuch.\n\nThen Masson asked if I’d like to come with him for a stroll on the beach.\n\n“My wife always has a nap after lunch,” he said. “Personally I find it\ndoesn’t agree with me; what I need is a short walk. I’m always telling her\nit’s much better for the health. But, of course, she’s entitled to her own\nopinion.”\n\nMarie proposed to stay and help with the washing up. Mme Masson smiled\nand said that, in that case, the first thing was to get the men out of the way.\nSo we went out together, the three of us.\n\nThe light was almost vertical and the glare from the water seared one’s\neyes. The beach was quite deserted now. One could hear a faint tinkle of\nknives and forks and crockery in the shacks and bungalows lining the\nforeshore. Heat was welling up from the rocks, and one could hardly\nbreathe.\n\nAt first Raymond and Masson talked of things and people I didn’t know. I\ngathered that they’d been acquainted for some time and had even lived\ntogether for a while. We went down to the water’s edge and walked along it;\nnow and then a longer wave wet our canvas shoes. I wasn’t thinking of\nanything, as all that sunlight beating down on my bare head made me feel\nhalf asleep.\n\nJust then Raymond said something to Masson that I didn’t quite catch. But\nat the same moment I noticed two Arabs in blue dungarees a long way\ndown the beach, coming in our direction. I gave Raymond a look and he\nnodded, saying, “That’s him.” We walked steadily on. Masson wondered\nhow they’d managed to track us here. My impression was that they had\nseen us taking the bus and noticed Marie’s oilcloth bathing bag; but I didn’t\nsay anything.\n\nThough the Arabs walked quite slowly, they were much nearer already. We\ndidn’t change our pace, but Raymond said:\n“Listen! If there’s a roughhouse, you, Masson, take on the second one. I’ll\ntackle the fellow who’s after me. And you, Meursault, stand by to help if\nanother one comes up, and lay him out.”\n\nI said, “Right,” and Masson put his hands in his pockets.\n\nThe sand was as hot as fire, and I could have sworn it was glowing red. The\ndistance between us and the Arabs was steadily decreasing. When we were\nonly a few steps away the Arabs halted. Masson and I slowed down, while\nRaymond went straight up to his man. I couldn’t hear what he said, but I\nsaw the native lowering his head, as if to butt him in the chest. Raymond\nlashed out promptly and shouted to Masson to come. Masson went up to the\nman he had been marking and struck him twice with all his might. The\nfellow fell flat into the water and stayed there some seconds with bubbles\ncoming up to the surface round his head. Meanwhile Raymond had been\nslogging the other man, whose face was streaming with blood. He glanced\nat me over his shoulder and shouted:\n\n“Just you watch! I ain’t finished with him yet!”\n\n“Look out!” I cried. “He’s got a knife.”\n\nI spoke too late. The man had gashed Raymond’s arm and his mouth as\nwell.\n\nMasson sprang forward. The other Arab got up from the water and placed\nhimself behind the fellow with the knife. We didn’t dare to move. The two\nnatives backed away slowly, keeping us at bay with the knife and never\ntaking their eyes off us. When they were at a safe distance they swung\nround and took to their heels. We stood stock-still, with the sunlight beating\ndown on us. Blood was dripping from Raymond’s wounded arm, which he\nwas squeezing hard above the elbow.\n\nMasson remarked that there was a doctor who always spent his Sundays\nhere, and Raymond said: “Good. Let’s go to him at once.” He could hardly\nget the words out, as the blood from his other wound made bubbles in his\nmouth.\nWe each gave him an arm and helped him back to the bungalow. Once we\nwere there he told us the wounds weren’t so very deep and he could walk to\nwhere the doctor was. Marie had gone quite pale, and Mme Masson was in\ntears.\n\nMasson and Raymond went off to the doctor’s while I was left behind at the\nbungalow to explain matters to the women. I didn’t much relish the task and\nsoon dried up and started smoking, staring at the sea.\n\nRaymond came back at about half-past one, accompanied by Masson. He\nhad his arm bandaged and a strip of sticking plaster on the corner of his\nmouth. The doctor had assured him it was nothing serious, but he was\nlooking very glum. Masson tried to make him laugh, but without success.\n\nPresently Raymond said he was going for a stroll on the beach. I asked him\nwhere he proposed to go, and he mumbled something about “wanting to\ntake the air.” We—Masson and I—then said we’d go with him, but he flew\ninto a rage and told us to mind our own business. Masson said we mustn’t\ninsist, seeing the state he was in. However, when he went out, I followed\nhim.\n\nIt was like a furnace outside, with the sunlight splintering into flakes of fire\non the sand and sea. We walked for quite a while, and I had an idea that\nRaymond had a definite idea where he was going; but probably I was\nmistaken about this.\n\nAt the end of the beach we came to a small stream that had cut a channel in\nthe sand, after coming out from behind a biggish rock. There we found our\ntwo Arabs again, lying on the sand in their blue dungarees. They looked\nharmless enough, as if they didn’t bear any malice, and neither made any\nmove when we approached. The man who had slashed Raymond stared at\nhim without speaking. The other man was blowing down a little reed and\nextracting from it three notes of the scale, which he played over and over\nagain, while he watched us from the corner of an eye.\n\nFor a while nobody moved; it was all sunlight and silence except for the\ntinkle of the stream and those three little lonely sounds. Then Raymond put\nhis hand to his revolver pocket, but the Arabs still didn’t move. I noticed the\nman playing on the reed had his big toes splayed out almost at right angles\nto his feet.\n\nStill keeping his eyes on his man, Raymond said to me: “Shall I plug him\none?”\n\nI thought quickly. If I told him not to, considering the mood he was in, he\nmight very well fly into a temper and use his gun. So I said the first thing\nthat came into my head.\n\n“He hasn’t spoken to you yet. It would be a lowdown trick to shoot him like\nthat, in cold blood.”\n\nAgain, for some moments one heard nothing but the tinkle of the stream\nand the flute notes weaving through the hot, still air.\n\n“Well,” Raymond said at last, “if that’s how you feel, I’d better say\nsomething insulting, and if he answers back I’ll loose off.”\n\n“Right,” I said. “Only, if he doesn’t get out his knife you’ve no business to\nfire.”\n\nRaymond was beginning to fidget. The Arab with the reed went on playing,\nand both of them watched all our movements.\n\n“Listen,” I said to Raymond. “You take on the fellow on the right, and give\nme your revolver. If the other one starts making trouble or gets out his\nknife, I’ll shoot.”\n\nThe sun glinted on Raymond’s revolver as he handed it to me. But nobody\nmade a move yet; it was just as if everything had closed in on us so that we\ncouldn’t stir. We could only watch each other, never lowering our eyes; the\nwhole world seemed to have come to a standstill on this little strip of sand\nbetween the sunlight and the sea, the twofold silence of the reed and stream.\nAnd just then it crossed my mind that one might fire, or not fire—and it\nwould come to absolutely the same thing.\nThen, all of a sudden, the Arabs vanished; they’d slipped like lizards under\ncover of the rock. So Raymond and I turned and walked back. He seemed\nhappier, and began talking about the bus to catch for our return.\n\nWhen we reached the bungalow Raymond promptly went up the wooden\nsteps, but I halted on the bottom one. The light seemed thudding in my head\nand I couldn’t face the effort needed to go up the steps and make myself\namiable to the women. But the heat was so great that it was just as bad\nstaying where I was, under that flood of blinding light falling from the sky.\nTo stay, or to make a move—it came to much the same. After a moment I\nreturned to the beach, and started walking.\n\nThere was the same red glare as far as eye could reach, and small waves\nwere lapping the hot sand in little, flurried gasps. As I slowly walked\ntoward the boulders at the end of the beach I could feel my temples\nswelling under the impact of the light. It pressed itself on me, trying to\ncheck my progress. And each time I felt a hot blast strike my forehead, I\ngritted my teeth, I clenched my fists in my trouser pockets and keyed up\nevery nerve to fend off the sun and the dark befuddlement it was pouring\ninto me. Whenever a blade of vivid light shot upward from a bit of shell or\nbroken glass lying on the sand, my jaws set hard. I wasn’t going to be\nbeaten, and I walked steadily on.\n\nThe small black hump of rock came into view far down the beach. It was\nrimmed by a dazzling sheen of light and feathery spray, but I was thinking\nof the cold, clear stream behind it, and longing to hear again the tinkle of\nrunning water. Anything to be rid of the glare, the sight of women in tears,\nthe strain and effort—and to retrieve the pool of shadow by the rock and its\ncool silence!\n\nBut when I came nearer I saw that Raymond’s Arab had returned. He was\nby himself this time, lying on his back, his hands behind his head, his face\nshaded by the rock while the sun beat on the rest of his body. One could see\nhis dungarees steaming in the heat. I was rather taken aback; my impression\nhad been that the incident was closed, and I hadn’t given a thought to it on\nmy way here.\nOn seeing me, the Arab raised himself a little, and his hand went to his\npocket. Naturally, I gripped Raymond’s revolver in the pocket of my coat.\nThen the Arab let himself sink back again, but without taking his hand from\nhis pocket. I was some distance off, at least ten yards, and most of the time I\nsaw him as a blurred dark form wobbling in the heat haze. Sometimes,\nhowever, I had glimpses of his eyes glowing between the half-closed lids.\nThe sound of the waves was even lazier, feebler, than at noon. But the light\nhadn’t changed; it was pounding as fiercely as ever on the long stretch of\nsand that ended at the rock. For two hours the sun seemed to have made no\nprogress; becalmed in a sea of molten steel. Far out on the horizon a\nsteamer was passing; I could just make out from the corner of an eye the\nsmall black moving patch, while I kept my gaze fixed on the Arab.\n\nIt struck me that all I had to do was to turn, walk away, and think no more\nabout it. But the whole beach, pulsing with heat, was pressing on my back. I\ntook some steps toward the stream. The Arab didn’t move. After all, there\nwas still some distance between us. Perhaps because of the shadow on his\nface, he seemed to be grinning at me.\n\nI waited. The heat was beginning to scorch my cheeks; beads of sweat were\ngathering in my eyebrows. It was just the same sort of heat as at my\nmother’s funeral, and I had the same disagreeable sensations—especially in\nmy forehead, where all the veins seemed to be bursting through the skin. I\ncouldn’t stand it any longer, and took another step forward. I knew it was a\nfool thing to do; I wouldn’t get out of the sun by moving on a yard or so.\nBut I took that step, just one step, forward. And then the Arab drew his\nknife and held it up toward me, athwart the sunlight.\n\nA shaft of light shot upward from the steel, and I felt as if a long, thin blade\ntransfixed my forehead. At the same moment all the sweat that had\naccumulated in my eyebrows splashed down on my eyelids, covering them\nwith a warm film of moisture. Beneath a veil of brine and tears my eyes\nwere blinded; I was conscious only of the cymbals of the sun clashing on\nmy skull, and, less distinctly, of the keen blade of light flashing up from the\nknife, scarring my eyelashes, and gouging into my eyeballs.\n\nThen everything began to reel before my eyes, a fiery gust came from the\nsea, while the sky cracked in two, from end to end, and a great sheet of\nflame poured down through the rift. Every nerve in my body was a steel\nspring, and my grip closed on the revolver. The trigger gave, and the\nsmooth underbelly of the butt jogged my palm. And so, with that crisp,\nwhipcrack sound, it all began. I shook off my sweat and the clinging veil of\nlight. I knew I’d shattered the balance of the day, the spacious calm of this\nbeach on which I had been happy. But I fired four shots more into the inert\nbody, on which they left no visible trace. And each successive shot was\nanother loud, fateful rap on the door of my undoing.\nPart Two\nI\nI was questioned several times immediately after my arrest. But they were\nall formal examinations, as to my identity and so forth. At the first of these,\nwhich took place at the police station, nobody seemed to have much interest\nin the case. However, when I was brought before the examining magistrate\na week later, I noticed that he eyed me with distinct curiosity. Like the\nothers, he began by asking my name, address, and occupation, the date and\nplace of my birth. Then he inquired if I had chosen a lawyer to defend me. I\nanswered, “No,” I hadn’t thought about it, and asked him if it was really\nnecessary for me to have one.\n\n“Why do you ask that?” he said. I replied that I regarded my case as very\nsimple. He smiled. “Well, it may seem so to you. But we’ve got to abide by\nthe law, and, if you don’t engage a lawyer, the court will have to appoint\none for you.”\n\nIt struck me as an excellent arrangement that the authorities should see to\ndetails of this kind, and I told him so. He nodded, and agreed that the Code\nwas all that could be desired.\n\nAt first I didn’t take him quite seriously. The room in which he interviewed\nme was much like an ordinary sitting room, with curtained windows, and a\nsingle lamp standing on the desk. Its light fell on the armchair in which he’d\nhad me sit, while his own face stayed in shadow.\n\nI had read descriptions of such scenes in books, and at first it all seemed\nlike a game. After our conversation, however, I had a good look at him. He\nwas a tall man with clean-cut features, deep-set blue eyes, a big gray\nmustache, and abundant, almost snow-white hair, and he gave me the\nimpression of being highly intelligent and, on the whole, likable enough.\nThere was only one thing that put one off: his mouth had now and then a\nrather ugly twist; but it seemed to be only a sort of nervous tic. When\nleaving, I very nearly held out my hand and said, “Good-by”; just in time I\nremembered that I’d killed a man.\nNext day a lawyer came to my cell; a small, plump, youngish man with\nsleek black hair. In spite of the heat—I was in my shirt sleeves—he was\nwearing a dark suit, stiff collar, and a rather showy tie, with broad black and\nwhite stripes. After depositing his brief case on my bed, he introduced\nhimself, and added that he’d perused the record of my case with the utmost\ncare. His opinion was that it would need cautious handling, but there was\nevery prospect of my getting off, provided I followed his advice. I thanked\nhim, and he said: “Good. Now let’s get down to it.”\n\nSitting on the bed, he said that they’d been making investigations into my\nprivate life. They had learned that my mother died recently in a home.\nInquiries had been conducted at Marengo and the police informed that I’d\nshown “great callousness” at my mother’s funeral.\n\n“You must understand,” the lawyer said, “that I don’t relish having to\nquestion you about such a matter. But it has much importance, and, unless I\nfind some way of answering the charge of ‘callousness,’ I shall be\nhandicapped in conducting your defense. And that is where you, and only\nyou, can help me.”\n\nHe went on to ask if I had felt grief on that “sad occasion.” The question\nstruck me as an odd one; I’d have been much embarrassed if I’d had to ask\nanyone a thing like that.\n\nI answered that, of recent years, I’d rather lost the habit of noting my\nfeelings, and hardly knew what to answer. I could truthfully say I’d been\nquite fond of Mother—but really that didn’t mean much. All normal people,\nI added as on afterthought, had more or less desired the death of those they\nloved, at some time or another.\n\nHere the lawyer interrupted me, looking greatly perturbed.\n\n“You must promise me not to say anything of that sort at the trial, or to the\nexamining magistrate.”\n\nI promised, to satisfy him, but I explained that my physical condition at any\ngiven moment often influenced my feelings. For instance, on the day I\nattended Mother’s funeral, I was fagged out and only half awake. So, really,\nI hardly took stock of what was happening. Anyhow, I could assure him of\none thing: that I’d rather Mother hadn’t died.\n\nThe lawyer, however, looked displeased. “That’s not enough,” he said\ncurtly.\n\nAfter considering for a bit he asked me if he could say that on that day I had\nkept my feelings under control.\n\n“No,” I said. “That wouldn’t be true.”\n\nHe gave me a queer look, as if I slightly revolted him; then informed me, in\nan almost hostile tone, that in any case the head of the Home and some of\nthe staff would be cited as witnesses.\n\n“And that might do you a very nasty turn,” he concluded.\n\nWhen I suggested that Mother’s death had no connection with the charge\nagainst me, he merely replied that this remark showed I’d never had any\ndealings with the law.\n\nSoon after this he left, looking quite vexed. I wished he had stayed longer\nand I could have explained that I desired his sympathy, not for him to make\na better job of my defense, but, if I might put it so, spontaneously. I could\nsee that I got on his nerves; he couldn’t make me out, and, naturally\nenough, this irritated him. Once or twice I had a mind to assure him that I\nwas just like everybody else; quite an ordinary person. But really that would\nhave served no great purpose, and I let it go—out of laziness as much as\nanything else.\n\nLater in the day I was taken again to the examining magistrate’s office. It\nwas two in the afternoon and, this time, the room was flooded with light—\nthere was only a thin curtain on the window—and extremely hot.\n\nAfter inviting me to sit down, the magistrate informed me in a very polite\ntone that, “owing to unforeseen circumstances,” my lawyer was unable to\nbe present. I should be quite entitled, he added, to reserve my answers to his\nquestions until my lawyer could attend.\nTo this I replied that I could answer for myself. He pressed a bell push on\nhis desk and a young clerk came in and seated himself just behind me. Then\nwe—I and the magistrate—settled back in our chairs and the examination\nbegan. He led off by remarking that I had the reputation of being a taciturn,\nrather self-centered person, and he’d like to know what I had to say to that.\nI answered:\n\n“Well, I rarely have anything much to say. So, naturally I keep my mouth\nshut.”\n\nHe smiled as on the previous occasion, and agreed that that was the best of\nreasons. “In any case,” he added, “it has little or no importance.”\n\nAfter a short silence he suddenly leaned forward, looked me in the eyes,\nand said, raising his voice a little:\n\n“What really interests me is—you!”\n\nI wasn’t quite clear what he meant, so I made no comment.\n\n“There are several things,” he continued, “that puzzle me about your crime.\nI feel sure that you will help me to understand them.”\n\nWhen I replied that really it was quite simple, he asked me to give him an\naccount of what I’d done that day. As a matter of fact, I had already told\nhim at our first interview—in a summary sort of way, of course—about\nRaymond, the beach, our swim, the fight, then the beach again, and the five\nshots I’d fired. But I went over it all again, and after each phrase he nodded.\n“Quite so, quite so.” When I described the body lying on the sand, he\nnodded more emphatically, and said, “Good!” I was tired of repeating the\nsame story; I felt as if I’d never talked so much in all my life before.\n\nAfter another silence he stood up and said he’d like to help me; I interested\nhim, and, with God’s help, he would do something for me in my trouble.\nBut, first, he must put a few more questions.\n\nHe began by asking bluntly if I’d loved my mother.\n“Yes,” I replied, “like everybody else.” The clerk behind me, who had been\ntyping away at a steady pace, must just then have hit the wrong keys, as I\nheard him pushing the carrier back and crossing something out.\n\nNext, without any apparent logical connection, the magistrate sprang\nanother question.\n\n“Why did you fire five consecutive shots?”\n\nI thought for a bit; then explained that they weren’t quite consecutive. I\nfired one at first, and the other four after a short interval.\n\n“Why did you pause between the first and second shot?”\n\nI seemed to see it hovering again before my eyes, the red glow of the beach,\nand to feel that fiery breath on my cheeks—and, this time, I made no\nanswer.\n\nDuring the silence that followed, the magistrate kept fidgeting, running his\nfingers through his hair, half rising, then sitting down again. Finally,\nplanting his elbows on the desk, he bent toward me with a queer expression.\n\n“But why, why did you go on firing at a prostrate man?”\n\nAgain I found nothing to reply.\n\nThe magistrate drew his hand across his forehead and repeated in a slightly\ndifferent tone:\n\n“I ask you ‘Why?’ I insist on your telling me.” I still kept silent.\n\nSuddenly he rose, walked to a file cabinet standing against the opposite\nwall, pulled a drawer open, and took from it a silver crucifix, which he was\nwaving as he came back to the desk.\n\n“Do you know who this is?” His voice had changed completely; it was\nvibrant with emotion.\n\n“Of course I do,” I answered.\nThat seemed to start him off; he began speaking at a great pace. He told me\nhe believed in God, and that even the worst of sinners could obtain\nforgiveness of Him. But first he must repent, and become like a little child,\nwith a simple, trustful heart, open to conviction. He was leaning right across\nthe table, brandishing his crucifix before my eyes.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I had great difficulty in following his remarks, as, for\none thing, the office was so stiflingly hot and big flies were buzzing round\nand settling on my cheeks; also because he rather alarmed me. Of course, I\nrealized it was absurd to feel like this, considering that, after all, it was I\nwho was the criminal. However, as he continued talking, I did my best to\nunderstand, and I gathered that there was only one point in my confession\nthat badly needed clearing up—the fact that I’d waited before firing a\nsecond time. All the rest was, so to speak, quite in order; but that\ncompletely baffled him.\n\nI started to tell him that he was wrong in insisting on this; the point was of\nquite minor importance. But, before I could get the words out, he had drawn\nhimself up to his full height and was asking me very earnestly if I believed\nin God. When I said, “No,” he plumped down into his chair indignantly.\n\nThat was unthinkable, he said; all men believe in God, even those who\nreject Him. Of this he was absolutely sure; if ever he came to doubt it, his\nlife would lose all meaning. “Do you wish,” he asked indignantly, “my life\nto have no meaning?” Really I couldn’t see how my wishes came into it,\nand I told him as much.\n\nWhile I was talking, he thrust the crucifix again just under my nose and\nshouted: “I, anyhow, am a Christian. And I pray Him to forgive you for\nyour sins. My poor young man, how can you not believe that He suffered\nfor your sake?”\n\nI noticed that his manner seemed genuinely solicitous when he said, “My\npoor young man”—but I was beginning to have enough of it. The room was\ngrowing steadily hotter.\n\nAs I usually do when I want to get rid of someone whose conversation\nbores me, I pretended to agree. At which, rather to my surprise, his face lit\nup.\n\n“You see! You see! Now won’t you own that you believe and put your trust\nin Him?”\n\nI must have shaken my head again, for he sank back in his chair, looking\nlimp and dejected.\n\nFor some moments there was a silence during which the typewriter, which\nhad been clicking away all the time we talked, caught up with the last\nremark. Then he looked at me intently and rather sadly.\n\n“Never in all my experience have I known a soul so case-hardened as\nyours,” he said in a low tone. “All the criminals who have come before me\nuntil now wept when they saw this symbol of our Lord’s sufferings.”\n\nI was on the point of replying that was precisely because they were\ncriminals. But then I realized that I, too, came under that description.\nSomehow it was an idea to which I never could get reconciled.\n\nTo indicate, presumably, that the interview was over, the magistrate stood\nup. In the same weary tone he asked me a last question: Did I regret what I\nhad done?\n\nAfter thinking a bit, I said that what I felt was less regret than a kind of\nvexation—I couldn’t find a better word for it. But he didn’t seem to\nunderstand. ... This was as far as things went at that day’s interview.\n\nI came before the magistrate many times more, but on these occasions my\nlawyer always accompanied me. The examinations were confined to asking\nme to amplify my previous statements. Or else the magistrate and my\nlawyer discussed technicalities. At such times they took very little notice of\nme, and, in any case, the tone of the examinations changed as time went on.\nThe magistrate seemed to have lost interest in me, and to have come to\nsome sort-of decision about my case. He never mentioned God again or\ndisplayed any of the religious fervor I had found so embarrassing at our first\ninterview. The result was that our relations became more cordial. After a\nfew questions, followed by an exchange of remarks with the lawyer, the\nmagistrate closed the interview. My case was “taking its course,” as he put\nit. Sometimes, too, the conversation was of a general order, and the\nmagistrate and lawyer encouraged me to join in it. I began to breathe more\nfreely. Neither of the two men, at these times, showed the least hostility\ntoward me, and everything went so smoothly, so amiably, that I had an\nabsurd impression of being “one of the family.” I can honestly say that\nduring the eleven months these examinations lasted I got so used to them\nthat I was almost surprised at having ever enjoyed anything better than\nthose rare moments when the magistrate, after escorting me to the door of\nthe office, would pat my shoulder and say in a friendly tone: “Well, Mr.\nAntichrist, that’s all for the present!” After which I was made over to my\njailers.\n\nII\nTHERE are some things of which I’ve never cared to talk. And, a few days\nafter I’d been sent to prison, I decided that this phase of my life was one of\nthem. However, as time went by, I came to feel that this aversion had no\nreal substance. In point of fact, during those early days, I was hardly\nconscious of being in prison; I had always a vague hope that something\nwould turn up, some agreeable surprise.\n\nThe change came soon after Marie’s first and only visit. From the day when\nI got her letter telling me they wouldn’t let her come to see me any more,\nbecause she wasn’t my wife—it was from that day that I realized that this\ncell was my last home, a dead end, so to speak.\n\nOn the day of my arrest they put me in a biggish room with several other\nprisoners, mostly Arabs. They grinned when they saw me enter, and asked\nme what I’d done. I told them I’d killed an Arab, and they kept mum for a\nwhile. But presently night began to fall, and one of them explained to me\nhow to lay out my sleeping mat. By rolling up one end one makes a sort of\nbolster. All night I felt bugs crawling over my face.\n\nSome days later I was put by myself in a cell, where I slept on a plank bed\nhinged to the wall. The only other furniture was a latrine bucket and a tin\nbasin. The prison stands on rising ground, and through my little window I\nhad glimpses of the sea. One day when I was hanging on the bars, straining\nmy eyes toward the sunlight playing on the waves, a jailer entered and said\nI had a visitor. I thought it must be Marie, and so it was.\n\nTo go to the Visitors’ Room, I was taken along a corridor, then up a flight of\nsteps, then along another corridor. It was a very large room, lit by a big bow\nwindow, and divided into three compartments by high iron grilles running\ntransversally. Between the two grilles there was a gap of some thirty feet, a\nsort of no man’s land between the prisoners and their friends. I was led to a\npoint exactly opposite Marie, who was wearing her striped dress. On my\nside of the rails were about a dozen other prisoners, Arabs for the most part.\nOn Marie’s side were mostly Moorish women. She was wedged between a\nsmall old woman with tight-set lips and a fat matron, without a hat, who\nwas talking shrilly and gesticulated all the time. Because of the distance\nbetween the visitors and prisoners I found I, too, had to raise my voice.\n\nWhen I came into the room the babel of voices echoing on the bare walls,\nand the sunlight streaming in, flooding everything in a harsh white glare,\nmade me feel quite dizzy. After the relative darkness and the silence of my\ncell it took me some moments to get used to these conditions. After a bit,\nhowever, I came to see each face quite clearly, lit up as if a spotlight played\non it.\n\nI noticed a prison official seated at each end of the no man’s land between\nthe grilles. The native prisoners and their relations on the other side were\nsquatting opposite each other. They didn’t raise their voices and, in spite of\nthe din, managed to converse almost in whispers. This murmur of voices\ncoming from below made a sort of accompaniment to the conversations\ngoing on above their heads. I took stock of all this very quickly and moved\na step forward toward Marie. She was pressing her brown, sun-tanned face\nto the bars and smiling as hard as she could. I thought she was looking very\npretty, but somehow couldn’t bring myself to tell her so.\n\n“Well?” she asked, pitching her voice very high. “What about it? Are you\nall right, have you everything you want?”\n\n“Oh, yes. I’ve everything I want.”\nWe were silent for some moments; Marie went on smiling. The fat woman\nwas bawling at the prisoner beside me, her husband presumably, a tall, fair,\npleasant-looking man.\n\n“Jeanne refused to have him,” she yelled.\n\n“That’s just too bad,” the man replied.\n\n“Yes, and I told her you’d take him back the moment you got out; but she\nwouldn’t hear of it.”\n\nMarie shouted across the gap that Raymond sent me his best wishes, and I\nsaid, “Thanks.” But my voice was drowned by my neighbor’s, asking “if he\nwas quite fit.”\n\nThe fat woman gave a laugh. “Fit? I should say he is! The picture of\nhealth.”\n\nMeanwhile the prisoner on my left, a youngster with thin, girlish hands,\nnever said a word. His eyes, I noticed, were fixed on the little old woman\nopposite him, and she returned his gaze with a sort of hungry passion. But I\nhad to stop looking at them as Marie was shouting to me that we mustn’t\nlose hope.\n\n“Certainly not,” I answered. My gaze fell on her shoulders, and I had a\nsudden longing to squeeze them, through the thin dress. Its silky texture\nfascinated me, and I had a feeling that the hope she spoke of centered on it,\nsomehow. I imagine something of the same sort was in Marie’s mind, for\nshe went on smiling, looking straight at me.\n\n“It’ll all come right, you’ll see, and then we shall get married.”\n\nAll I could see of her now was the white flash of her teeth, and the little\npuckers round her eyes. I answered: “Do you really think so?” but chiefly\nbecause I felt it up to me to answer something.\n\nShe started talking very fast in the same high-pitched voice.\n\n“Yes, you’ll be acquitted, and we’ll go bathing again, Sundays.”\nThe woman beside me was still yelling away, telling her husband that she’d\nleft a basket for him in the prison office. She gave a list of the things she’d\nbrought and told him to mind and check them carefully, as some had cost\nquite a lot. The youngster on my other side and his mother were still gazing\nmournfully at each other, and the murmur of the Arabs droned on below us.\nThe light outside seemed to be surging up against the window, seeping\nthrough, and smearing the faces of the people facing it with a coat of yellow\noil.\n\nI began to feel slightly squeamish, and wished I could leave. The strident\nvoice beside me was jarring on my ears. But, on the other hand, I wanted to\nhave the most I could of Marie’s company. I’ve no idea how much time\npassed. I remember Marie’s describing to me her work, with that set smile\nalways on her face. There wasn’t a moment’s letup in the noise—shouts,\nconversations, and always that muttering undertone. The only oasis of\nsilence was made by the young fellow and the old woman gazing into each\nother’s eyes.\n\nThen, one by one, the Arabs were led away; almost everyone fell silent\nwhen the first one left. The little old woman pressed herself against the bars\nand at the same moment a jailer tapped her son’s shoulder. He called, “Au\nrevoir, Mother,” and, slipping her hand between the bars, she gave him a\nsmall, slow wave with it.\n\nNo sooner was she gone than a man, hat in hand, took her place. A prisoner\nwas led up to the empty place beside me, and the two started a brisk\nexchange of remarks—not loud, however, as the room had become\nrelatively quiet. Someone came and called away the man on my right, and\nhis wife shouted at him—she didn’t seem to realize it was no longer\nnecessary to shout—“Now, mind you look after yourself, dear, and don’t do\nanything rash!”\n\nMy turn came next. Marie threw me a kiss. I looked back as I walked away.\nShe hadn’t moved; her face was still pressed to the rails, her lips still parted\nin that tense, twisted smile.\n\nSoon after this I had a letter from her. And it was then that the things I’ve\nnever liked to talk about began. Not that they were particularly terrible; I’ve\nno wish to exaggerate and I suffered less than others. Still, there was one\nthing in those early days that was really irksome: my habit of thinking like a\nfree man. For instance, I would suddenly be seized with a desire to go down\nto the beach for a swim. And merely to have imagined the sound of ripples\nat my feet, the smooth feel of the water on my body as I struck out, and the\nwonderful sensation of relief it gave brought home still more cruelly the\nnarrowness of my cell.\n\nStill, that phase lasted a few months only. Afterward, I had prisoner’s\nthoughts. I waited for the daily walk in the courtyard or a visit from my\nlawyer. As for the rest of the time, I managed quite well, really. I’ve often\nthought that had I been compelled to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with\nnothing to do but gaze up at the patch of sky just overhead, I’d have got\nused to it by degrees. I’d have learned to watch for the passing of birds or\ndrifting clouds, as I had come to watch for my lawyer’s odd neckties, or, in\nanother world, to wait patiently till Sunday for a spell of love-making with\nMarie. Well, here, anyhow, I wasn’t penned in a hollow tree trunk. There\nwere others in the world worse off than I. I remembered it had been one of\nMother’s pet ideas—she was always voicing it—that in the long run one\ngets used to anything.\n\nUsually, however, I didn’t think things out so far. Those first months were\ntrying, of course; but the very effort I had to make helped me through them.\nFor instance, I was plagued by the desire for a woman—which was natural\nenough, considering my age. I never thought of Marie especially. I was\nobsessed by thoughts of this woman or that, of all the ones I’d had, all the\ncircumstances under which I’d loved them; so much so that the cell grew\ncrowded with their faces, ghosts of my old passions. That unsettled me, no\ndoubt; but, at least, it served to kill time.\n\nI gradually became quite friendly with the chief jailer, who went the rounds\nwith the kitchen hands at mealtimes. It was he who brought up the subject\nof women. “That’s what the men here grumble about most,” he told me.\n\nI said I felt like that myself. “There’s something unfair about it,” I added,\n“like hitting a man when he’s down.”\n“But that’s the whole point of it,” he said; “that’s why you fellows are kept\nin prison.”\n\n“I don’t follow.”\n\n“Liberty,” he said, “means that. You’re being deprived of your liberty.”\n\nIt had never before struck me in that light, but I saw his point. “That’s true,”\nI said. “Otherwise it wouldn’t be a punishment.”\n\nThe jailer nodded. “Yes, you’re different, you can use your brains. The\nothers can’t. Still, those fellows find a way out; they do it by themselves.”\nWith which remark the jailer left my cell. Next day I did like the others.\n\nThe lack of cigarettes, too, was a trial. When I was brought to the prison,\nthey took away my belt, my shoelaces, and the contents of my pockets,\nincluding my cigarettes. Once I had been given a cell to myself I asked to\nbe given back, anyhow, the cigarettes. Smoking was forbidden, they\ninformed me. That, perhaps, was what got me down the most; in fact, I\nsuffered really badly during the first few days. I even tore off splinters from\nmy plank bed and sucked them. All day long I felt faint and bilious. It\npassed my understanding why I shouldn’t be allowed even to smoke; it\ncould have done no one any harm. Later on, I understood the idea behind it;\nthis privation, too, was part of my punishment. But, by the time I\nunderstood, I’d lost the craving, so it had ceased to be a punishment.\n\nExcept for these privations I wasn’t too unhappy. Yet again, the whole\nproblem was: how to kill time. After a while, however, once I’d learned the\ntrick of remembering things, I never had a moment’s boredom. Sometimes I\nwould exercise my memory on my bedroom and, starting from a corner,\nmake the round, noting every object I saw on the way. At first it was over in\na minute or two. But each time I repeated the experience, it took a little\nlonger. I made a point of visualizing every piece of furniture, and each\narticle upon or in it, and then every detail of each article, and finally the\ndetails of the details, so to speak: a tiny dent or incrustation, or a chipped\nedge, and the exact grain and color of the woodwork. At the same time I\nforced myself to keep my inventory in mind from start to finish, in the right\norder and omitting no item. With the result that, after a few weeks, I could\nspend hours merely in listing the objects in my bedroom. I found that the\nmore I thought, the more details, half-forgotten or malobserved, floated up\nfrom my memory. There seemed no end to them.\n\nSo I learned that even after a single day’s experience of the outside world a\nman could easily live a hundred years in prison. He’d have laid up enough\nmemories never to be bored. Obviously, in one way, this was a\ncompensation.\n\nThen there was sleep. To begin with, I slept badly at night and never in the\nday. But gradually my nights became better, and I managed to doze off in\nthe daytime as well. In fact, during the last months, I must have slept\nsixteen or eighteen hours out of the twenty-four. So there remained only six\nhours to fill—with meals, relieving nature, my memories ... and the story of\nthe Czech.\n\nOne day, when inspecting my straw mattress, I found a bit of newspaper\nstuck to its underside. The paper was yellow with age, almost transparent,\nbut I could still make out the letter print. It was the story of a crime. The\nfirst part was missing, but I gathered that its scene was some village in\nCzechoslovakia. One of the villagers had left his home to try his luck\nabroad. After twenty-five years, having made a fortune, he returned to his\ncountry with his wife and child. Meanwhile his mother and sister had been\nrunning a small hotel in the village where he was born. He decided to give\nthem a surprise and, leaving his wife and child in another inn, he went to\nstay at his mother’s place, booking a room under an assumed name. His\nmother and sister completely failed to recognize him. At dinner that\nevening he showed them a large sum of money he had on him, and in the\ncourse of the night they slaughtered him with a hammer. After taking the\nmoney they flung the body into the river. Next morning his wife came and,\nwithout thinking, betrayed the guest’s identity. His mother hanged herself.\nHis sister threw herself into a well. I must have read that story thousands of\ntimes. In one way it sounded most unlikely; in another, it was plausible\nenough. Anyhow, to my mind, the man was asking for trouble; one\nshouldn’t play fool tricks of that sort.\n\nSo, what with long bouts of sleep, my memories, readings of that scrap of\nnewspaper, the tides of light and darkness, the days slipped by. I’d read, of\ncourse, that in jail one ends up by losing track of time. But this had never\nmeant anything definite to me. I hadn’t grasped how days could be at once\nlong and short. Long, no doubt, as periods to live through, but so distended\nthat they ended up by overlapping on each other. In fact, I never thought of\ndays as such; only the words “yesterday” and “tomorrow” still kept some\nmeaning.\n\nWhen, one morning, the jailer informed me I’d now been six months in jail,\nI believed him—but the words conveyed nothing to my mind. To me it\nseemed like one and the same day that had been going on since I’d been in\nmy cell, and that I’d been doing the same thing all the time.\n\nAfter the jailer left me I shined up my tin pannikin and studied my face in\nit. My expression was terribly serious, I thought, even when I tried to smile.\nI held the pannikin at different angles, but always my face had the same\nmournful, tense expression.\n\nThe sun was setting and it was the hour of which I’d rather not speak—“the\nnameless hour,” I called it—when evening sounds were creeping up from\nall the floors of the prison in a sort of stealthy procession. I went to the\nbarred window and in the last rays looked once again at my reflected face.\nIt was as serious as before; and that wasn’t surprising, as just then I was\nfeeling serious. But, at the same time, I heard something that I hadn’t heard\nfor months. It was the sound of a voice; my own voice, there was no\nmistaking it. And I recognized it as the voice that for many a day of late had\nbeen sounding in my ears. So I knew that all this time I’d been talking to\nmyself.\n\nAnd something I’d been told came back; a remark made by the nurse at\nMother’s funeral. No, there was no way out, and no one can imagine what\nthe evenings are like in prison.\nIII\nON THE whole I can’t say that those months passed slowly; another\nsummer was on its way almost before I realized the first was over. And I\nknew that with the first really hot days something new was in store for me.\nMy case was down for the last sessions of the Assize Court, and those\nsessions were due to end some time in June.\n\nThe day on which my trial started was one of brilliant sunshine. My lawyer\nassured me the case would take only two or three days. “From what I hear,”\nhe added, “the court will dispatch your case as quickly as possible, as it\nisn’t the most important one on the Cause List. There’s a case of parricide\nimmediately after, which will take them some time.”\n\nThey came for me at half-past seven in the morning and I was conveyed to\nthe law courts in a prison van. The two policemen led me into a small room\nthat smelled of darkness. We sat near a door through which came sounds of\nvoices, shouts, chairs scraping on the floor; a vague hubbub which\nreminded me of one of those small-town “socials” when, after the concert’s\nover, the hall is cleared for dancing.\n\nOne of my policemen told me the judges hadn’t arrived yet, and offered me\na cigarette, which I declined. After a bit he asked me if I was feeling\nnervous. I said, “No,” and that the prospect of witnessing a trial rather\ninterested me; I’d never had occasion to attend one before.\n\n“Maybe,” the other policeman said. “But after an hour or two one’s had\nenough of it.”\n\nAfter a while a small electric bell purred in the room. They unfastened my\nhandcuffs, opened the door, and led me to the prisoner’s dock.\n\nThere was a great crowd in the courtroom. Though the Venetian blinds were\ndown, light was filtering through the chinks, and the air stiflingly hot\nalready. The windows had been kept shut. I sat down, and the police\nofficers took their stand on each side of my chair.\nIt was then that I noticed a row of faces opposite me. These people were\nstaring hard at me, and I guessed they were the jury. But somehow I didn’t\nsee them as individuals. I felt as you do just after boarding a streetcar and\nyou’re conscious of all the people on the opposite seat staring at you in the\nhope of finding something in your appearance to amuse them. Of course, I\nknew this was an absurd comparison; what these people were looking for in\nme wasn’t anything to laugh at, but signs of criminality. Still, the difference\nwasn’t so very great, and, anyhow, that’s the idea I got.\n\nWhat with the crowd and the stuffiness of the air I was feeling a bit dizzy. I\nran my eyes round the courtroom but couldn’t recognize any of the faces.\nAt first I could hardly believe that all these people had come on my\naccount. It was such a new experience, being a focus of interest; in the\nordinary way no one ever paid much attention to me.\n\n“What a crush!” I remarked to the policeman on my left, and he explained\nthat the newspapers were responsible for it.\n\nHe pointed to a group of men at a table just below the jury box. “There they\nare!”\n\n“Who?” I asked, and he replied, “The press.” One of them, he added, was\nan old friend of his.\n\nA moment later the man he’d mentioned looked our way and, coming to the\ndock, shook hands warmly with the policeman. The journalist was an\nelderly man with a rather grim expression, but his manner was quite\npleasant. Just then I noticed that almost all the people in the courtroom were\ngreeting each other, exchanging remarks and forming groups—behaving, in\nfact, as in a club where the company of others of one’s own tastes and\nstanding makes one feel at ease. That, no doubt, explained the odd\nimpression I had of being de trop here, a sort of gate-crasher.\n\nHowever, the journalist addressed me quite amiably, and said he hoped all\nwould go well for me. I thanked him, and he added with a smile:\n\n“You know, we’ve been featuring you a bit. We’re always rather short of\ncopy in the summer, and there’s been precious little to write about except\nyour case and the one that’s coming on after it. I expect you’ve heard about\nit; it’s a case of parricide.”\n\nHe drew my attention to one of the group at the press table, a plump, small\nman with huge black-rimmed glasses, who made me think of an overfed\nweasel.\n\n“That fellow’s the special correspondent of one of the Paris dailies. As a\nmatter of fact, he didn’t come on your account. He was sent for the\nparricide case, but they’ve asked him to cover yours as well.”\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to say, “That was very kind of them,” but\nthen I thought it would sound silly. With a friendly wave of his hand he left\nus, and for some minutes nothing happened.\n\nThen, accompanied by some colleagues, my lawyer bustled in, in his gown.\nHe went up to the press table and shook hands with the journalists. They\nremained laughing and chatting together, all seemingly very much at home\nhere, until a bell rang shrilly and everyone went to his place. My lawyer\ncame up to me, shook hands, and advised me to answer all the questions as\nbriefly as possible, not to volunteer information, and to rely on him to see\nme through.\n\nI heard a chair scrape on my left, and a tall, thin man wearing pince-nez\nsettled the folds of his red gown as he took his seat. The Public Prosecutor,\nI gathered. A clerk of the court announced that Their Honors were entering,\nand at the same moment two big electric fans started buzzing overhead.\nThree judges, two in black and the third in scarlet, with brief cases under\ntheir arms, entered and walked briskly to the bench, which was several feet\nabove the level of the courtroom floor. The man in scarlet took the central,\nhigh-backed chair, placed his cap of office on the table, ran a handkerchief\nover his small bald crown, and announced that the hearing would now\nbegin.\n\nThe journalists had their fountain pens ready; they all wore the same\nexpression of slightly ironical indifference, with the exception of one, a\nmuch younger man than his colleagues, in gray flannels with a blue tie,\nwho, leaving his pen on the table, was gazing hard at me. He had a plain,\nrather chunky face; what held my attention were his eyes, very pale, clear\neyes, riveted on me, though not betraying any definite emotion. For a\nmoment I had an odd impression, as if I were being scrutinized by myself.\nThat—and the fact that I was unfamiliar with court procedure—may\nexplain why I didn’t follow very well the opening phases: the drawing of\nlots for the jury, the various questions put by the presiding judge to the\nProsecutor, the foreman of the jury, and my counsel (each time he spoke all\nthe jurymen’s heads swung round together toward the bench), the hurried\nreading of the charge sheet, in the course of which I recognized some\nfamiliar names of people and places; then some supplementary questions\nput to my lawyer.\n\nNext, the Judge announced that the court would call over the witness list.\nSome of the names read out by the clerk rather surprised me. From amongst\nthe crowd, which until now I had seen as a mere blur of faces, rose, one\nafter the other, Raymond, Masson, Salamano, the doorkeeper from the\nHome, old Pérez, and Marie, who gave me a little nervous wave of her hand\nbefore following the others out by a side door. I was thinking how strange it\nwas I hadn’t noticed any of them before when I heard the last name called,\nthat of Céleste. As he rose, I noticed beside him the quaint little woman\nwith a mannish coat and brisk, decided air, who had shared my table at the\nrestaurant. She had her eyes fixed on me, I noticed. But I hadn’t time to\nwonder about her; the Judge had started speaking again.\n\nHe said that the trial proper was about to begin, and he need hardly say that\nhe expected the public to refrain from any demonstration whatsoever. He\nexplained that he was there to supervise the proceedings, as a sort of\numpire, and he would take a scrupulously impartial view of the case. The\nverdict of the jury would be interpreted by him in a spirit of justice. Finally,\nat the least sign of a disturbance he would have the court cleared.\n\nThe day was stoking up. Some of the public were fanning themselves with\nnewspapers, and there was a constant rustle of crumpled paper. On a sign\nfrom the presiding judge the clerk of the court brought three fans of plaited\nstraw, which the three judges promptly put in action.\n\nMy examination began at once. The Judge questioned me quite calmly and\neven, I thought, with a hint of cordiality. For the nth time I was asked to\ngive particulars of my identity and, though heartily sick of this formality, I\nrealized that it was natural enough; after all, it would be a shocking thing\nfor the court to be trying the wrong man.\n\nThe Judge then launched into an account of what I’d done, stopping after\nevery two or three sentences to ask me, “Is that correct?” To which I always\nreplied, “Yes, sir,” as my lawyer had advised me. It was a long business, as\nthe Judge lingered on each detail. Meanwhile the journalists scribbled\nbusily away. But I was sometimes conscious of the eyes of the youngest\nfixed on me; also those of the queer little robot woman. The jurymen,\nhowever, were all gazing at the red-robed judge, and I was again reminded\nof the row of passengers on one side of a tram. Presently he gave a slight\ncough, turned some pages of his file, and, still fanning his face, addressed\nme gravely.\n\nHe now proposed, he said, to trench on certain matters which, on a\nsuperficial view, might seem foreign to the case, but actually were highly\nrelevant. I guessed that he was going to talk about Mother, and at the same\nmoment realized how odious I would find this. His first question was: Why\nhad I sent my mother to an institution? I replied that the reason was simple;\nI hadn’t enough money to see that she was properly looked after at home.\nThen he asked if the parting hadn’t caused me distress. I explained that\nneither Mother nor I expected much of one another—or, for that matter, of\nanybody else; so both of us had got used to the new conditions easily\nenough. The Judge then said that he had no wish to press the point, and\nasked the Prosecutor if he could think of any more questions that should be\nput to me at this stage.\n\nThe Prosecutor, who had his back half turned to me, said, without looking\nin my direction, that, subject to His Honor’s approval, he would like to\nknow if I’d gone back to the stream with the intention of killing the Arab. I\nsaid, “No.” In that case, why had I taken a revolver with me, and why go\nback precisely to that spot? I said it was a matter of pure chance. The\nProsecutor then observed in a nasty tone: “Very good. That will be all for\nthe present.”\n\nI couldn’t quite follow what came next. Anyhow, after some palavering\namong the bench, the Prosecutor, and my counsel, the presiding judge\nannounced that the court would now rise; there was an adjournment till the\nafternoon, when evidence would be taken.\n\nAlmost before I knew what was happening I was rushed out to the prison\nvan, which drove me back, and I was given my midday meal. After a short\ntime, just enough for me to realize how tired I was feeling, they came for\nme. I was back in the same room, confronting the same faces, and the whole\nthing started again. But the heat had meanwhile much increased, and by\nsome miracle fans had been procured for everyone: the jury, my lawyer, the\nProsecutor, and some of the journalists, too. The young man and the robot\nwoman were still at their places. But they were not fanning themselves and,\nas before, they never took their eyes off me.\n\nI wiped the sweat from my face, but I was barely conscious of where or\nwho I was until I heard the warden of the Home called to the witness box.\nWhen asked if my mother had complained about my conduct, he said,\n“Yes,” but that didn’t mean much; almost all the inmates of the Home had\ngrievances against their relatives. The Judge asked him to be more explicit;\ndid she reproach me with having sent her to the Home, and he said, “Yes,”\nagain. But this time he didn’t qualify his answer.\n\nTo another question he replied that on the day of the funeral he was\nsomewhat surprised by my calmness. Asked to explain what he meant by\n“my calmness,” the warden lowered his eyes and stared at his shoes for a\nmoment. Then he explained that I hadn’t wanted to see Mother’s body, or\nshed a single tear, and that I’d left immediately the funeral ended, without\nlingering at her grave. Another thing had surprised him. One of the\nundertaker’s men told him that I didn’t know my mother’s age. There was a\nshort silence; then the Judge asked him if he might take it that he was\nreferring to the prisoner in the dock. The warden seemed puzzled by this,\nand the Judge explained: “It’s a formal question. I am bound to put it.”\n\nThe Prosecutor was then asked if he had any questions to put, and he\nanswered loudly: “Certainly not! I have all I want.” His tone and the look of\ntriumph on his face, as he glanced at me, were so marked that I felt as I\nhadn’t felt for ages. I had a foolish desire to burst into tears. For the first\ntime I’d realized how all these people loathed me.\nAfter asking the jury and my lawyer if they had any questions, the Judge\nheard the doorkeeper’s evidence. On stepping into the box the man threw a\nglance at me, then looked away. Replying to questions, he said that I’d\ndeclined to see Mother’s body, I’d smoked cigarettes and slept, and drunk\ncafé au lait. It was then I felt a sort of wave of indignation spreading\nthrough the courtroom, and for the first time I understood that I was guilty.\nThey got the doorkeeper to repeat what he had said about the coffee and my\nsmoking.\n\nThe Prosecutor turned to me again, with a gloating look in his eyes. My\ncounsel asked the doorkeeper if he, too, hadn’t smoked. But the Prosecutor\ntook strong exception to this. “I’d like to know,” he cried indignantly, “who\nis on trial in this court. Or does my friend think that by aspersing a witness\nfor the prosecution he will shake the evidence, the abundant and cogent\nevidence, against his client?” None the less, the Judge told the doorkeeper\nto answer the question.\n\nThe old fellow fidgeted a bit. Then, “Well, I know I didn’t ought to have\ndone it,” he mumbled, “but I did take a cigarette from the young gentleman\nwhen he offered it—just out of politeness.”\n\nThe Judge asked me if I had any comment to make. “None,” I said, “except\nthat the witness is quite right. It’s true I offered him a cigarette.”\n\nThe doorkeeper looked at me with surprise and a sort of gratitude. Then,\nafter hemming and hawing for a bit, he volunteered the statement that it was\nhe who’d suggested I should have some coffee.\n\nMy lawyer was exultant. “The jury will appreciate,” he said, “the\nimportance of this admission.”\n\nThe Prosecutor, however, was promptly on his feet again. “Quite so,” he\nboomed above our heads. “The jury will appreciate it. And they will draw\nthe conclusion that, though a third party might inadvertently offer him a cup\nof coffee, the prisoner, in common decency, should have refused it, if only\nout of respect for the dead body of the poor woman who had brought him\ninto the world.”\nAfter which the doorkeeper went back to his seat.\n\nWhen Thomas Pérez was called, a court officer had. to help him to the box.\nPérez stated that, though he had been a great friend of my mother, he had\nmet me once only, on the day of the funeral. Asked how I had behaved that\nday, he said:\n\n“Well, I was most upset, you know. Far too much upset to notice things. My\ngrief sort of blinded me, I think. It had been a great shock, my dear friend’s\ndeath; in fact, I fainted during the funeral. So I didn’t hardly notice the\nyoung gentleman at all.”\n\nThe Prosecutor asked him to tell the court if he’d seen me weep. And when\nPérez answered, “No,” added emphatically: “I trust the jury will take note\nof this reply.”\n\nMy lawyer rose at once, and asked Pérez in a tone that seemed to me\nneedlessly aggressive:\n\n“Now, think well, my man! Can you swear you saw he didn’t shed a tear?”\n\nPérez answered, “No.”\n\nAt this some people tittered, and my lawyer, pushing back one sleeve of his\ngown, said sternly:\n\n“That is typical of the way this case is being conducted. No attempt is being\nmade to elicit the true facts.”\n\nThe Prosecutor ignored this remark; he was making dabs with his pencil on\nthe cover of his brief, seemingly quite indifferent.\n\nThere was a break of five minutes, during which my lawyer told me the\ncase was going very well indeed. Then Céleste was called. He was\nannounced as a witness for the defense. The defense meant me.\n\nNow and again Céleste threw me a glance; he kept squeezing his Panama\nhat between his hands as he gave evidence. He was in his best suit, the one\nhe wore when sometimes of a Sunday he went with me to the races. But\nevidently he hadn’t been able to get his collar on; the top of his shirt, I\nnoticed, was secured only by a brass stud. Asked if I was one of his\ncustomers, he said, “Yes, and a friend as well.” Asked to state his opinion of\nme, he said that I was “all right” and, when told to explain what he meant\nby that, he replied that everyone knew what that meant. “Was I a secretive\nsort of man?” “No,” he answered, “I shouldn’t call him that. But he isn’t\none to waste his breath, like a lot of folks.”\n\nThe Prosecutor asked him if I always settled my monthly bill at his\nrestaurant when he presented it. Céleste laughed. “Oh, he paid on the nail,\nall right. But the bills were just details-like, between him and me.” Then he\nwas asked to say what he thought about the crime. He placed his hands on\nthe rail of the box and one could see he had a speech all ready.\n\n“To my mind it was just an accident, or a stroke of bad luck, if you prefer.\nAnd a thing like that takes you off your guard.”\n\nHe wanted to continue, but the Judge cut him short. “Quite so. That’s all,\nthank you.”\n\nFor a bit Céleste seemed flabbergasted; then he explained that he hadn’t\nfinished what he wanted to say. They told him to continue, but to make it\nbrief.\n\nHe only repeated that it was “just an accident.”\n\n“That’s as it may be,” the Judge observed. “But what we are here for is to\ntry such accidents, according to law. You can stand down.”\n\nCéleste turned and gazed at me. His eyes were moist and his lips trembling.\nIt was exactly as if he’d said: “Well, I’ve done my best for you, old man.\nI’m afraid it hasn’t helped much. I’m sorry.”\n\nI didn’t say anything, or make any movement, but for the first time in my\nlife I wanted to kiss a man.\n\nThe Judge repeated his order to stand down, and Céleste returned to his\nplace amongst the crowd. During the rest of the hearing he remained there,\nleaning forward, elbows on knees and his Panama between his hands, not\nmissing a word of the proceedings.\n\nIt was Marie’s turn next. She had a hat on and still looked quite pretty,\nthough I much preferred her with her hair free. From where I was I had\nglimpses of the soft curve of her breasts, and her underlip had the little pout\nthat always fascinated me. She appeared very nervous.\n\nThe first question was: How long had she known me? Since the time when\nshe was in our office, she replied. Then the Judge asked her what were the\nrelations between us, and she said she was my girl friend. Answering\nanother question, she admitted promising to marry me. The Prosecutor, who\nhad been studying a document in front of him, asked her rather sharply\nwhen our “liaison” had begun. She gave the date. He then observed with a\nwould-be casual air that apparently she meant the day following my\nmother’s funeral. After letting this sink in he remarked in a slightly ironic\ntone that obviously this was a “delicate topic” and he could enter into the\nyoung lady’s feelings, but—and here his voice grew sterner—his duty\nobliged him to waive considerations of delicacy.\n\nAfter making this announcement he asked Marie to give a full account of\nour doings on the day when I had “intercourse” with her for the first time.\nMarie wouldn’t answer at first, but the Prosecutor insisted, and then she told\nhim that we had met at the baths, gone together to the pictures, and then to\nmy place. He then informed the court that, as a result of certain statements\nmade by Marie at the proceedings before the magistrate, he had studied the\nmovie programs of that date, and turning to Marie asked her to name the\nfilm that we had gone to see. In a very low voice she said it was a picture\nwith Fernandel in it. By the time she had finished, the courtroom was so\nstill you could have heard a pin drop.\n\nLooking very grave, the Prosecutor drew himself up to his full height and,\npointing at me, said in such a tone that I could have sworn he was genuinely\nmoved:\n\n“Gentlemen of the jury, I would have you note that on the next day after his\nmother’s funeral that man was visiting the swimming pool, starting a liaison\nwith a girl, and going to see a comic film. That is all I wish to say.”\nWhen he sat down there was the same dead silence. Then all of a sudden\nMarie burst into tears. He’d got it all wrong, she said; it wasn’t a bit like\nthat really, he’d bullied her into saying the opposite of what she meant. She\nknew me very well, and she was sure I hadn’t done anything really wrong—\nand so on. At a sign from the presiding judge, one of the court officers led\nher away, and the hearing continued.\n\nHardly anyone seemed to listen to Masson, the next witness. He stated that I\nwas a respectable young fellow; “and, what’s more, a very decent chap.”\nNor did they pay any more attention to Salamano, when he told them how\nkind I’d always been to his dog, or when, in answer to a question about my\nmother and myself, he said that Mother and I had very little in common and\nthat explained why I’d fixed up for her to enter the Home. “You’ve got to\nunderstand,” he added. “You’ve got to understand.” But no one seemed to\nunderstand. He was told to stand down.\n\nRaymond was the next, and last, witness. He gave me a little wave of his\nhand and led off by saying I was innocent. The Judge rebuked him.\n\n“You are here to give evidence, not your views on the case, and you must\nconfine yourself to answering the questions put you.”\n\nHe was then asked to make clear his relations with the deceased, and\nRaymond took this opportunity of explaining that it was he, not I, against\nwhom the dead man had a grudge, because he, Raymond, had beaten up his\nsister. The judge asked him if the deceased had no reason to dislike me, too.\nRaymond told him that my presence on the beach that morning was a pure\ncoincidence.\n\n“How comes it then,” the Prosecutor inquired, “that the letter which led up\nto this tragedy was the prisoner’s work?”\n\nRaymond replied that this, too, was due to mere chance.\n\nTo which the Prosecutor retorted that in this case “chance” or “mere\ncoincidence” seemed to play a remarkably large part. Was it by chance that\nI hadn’t intervened when Raymond assaulted his mistress? Did this\nconvenient term “chance” account for my having vouched for Raymond at\nthe police station and having made, on that occasion, statements\nextravagantly favorable to him? In conclusion he asked Raymond to state\nwhat were his means of livelihood.\n\nOn his describing himself as a warehouseman, the Prosecutor informed the\njury it was common knowledge that the witness lived on the immoral\nearnings of women. I, he said, was this man’s intimate friend and associate;\nin fact, the whole background of the crime was of the most squalid\ndescription. And what made it even more odious was the personality of the\nprisoner, an inhuman monster wholly without a moral sense.\n\nRaymond began to expostulate, and my lawyer, too, protested. They were\ntold that the Prosecutor must be allowed to finish his remarks.\n\n“I have nearly done,” he said; then turned to Raymond. “Was the prisoner\nyour friend?”\n\n“Certainly. We were the best of pals, as they say.”\n\nThe Prosecutor then put me the same question. I looked hard at Raymond,\nand he did not turn away.\n\nThen, “Yes,” I answered.\n\nThe Prosecutor turned toward the jury.\n\n“Not only did the man before you in the dock indulge in the most shameful\norgies on the day following his mother’s death. He killed a man cold-\nbloodedly, in pursuance of some sordid vendetta in the underworld of\nprostitutes and pimps. That, gentlemen of the jury, is the type of man the\nprisoner is.”\n\nNo sooner had he sat down than my lawyer, out of all patience, raised his\narms so high that his sleeves fell back, showing the full length of his\nstarched shirt cuffs.\n\n“Is my client on trial for having buried his mother, or for killing a man?” he\nasked.\nThere were some titters in court. But then the Prosecutor sprang to his feet\nand, draping his gown round him, said he was amazed at his friend’s\ningenuousness in failing to see that between these two elements of the case\nthere was a vital link. They hung together psychologically, if he might put it\nso. “In short,” he concluded, speaking with great vehemence, “I accuse the\nprisoner of behaving at his mother’s funeral in a way that showed he was\nalready a criminal at heart.”\n\nThese words seemed to take much effect on the jury and public. My lawyer\nmerely shrugged his shoulders and wiped the sweat from his forehead. But\nobviously he was rattled, and I had a feeling things weren’t going well for\nme.\n\nSoon after this incident the court rose. As I was being taken from the\ncourthouse to the prison van, I was conscious for a few brief moments of\nthe once familiar feel of a summer evening out-of-doors. And, sitting in the\ndarkness of my moving cell, I recognized, echoing in my tired brain, all the\ncharacteristic sounds of a town I’d loved, and of a certain hour of the day\nwhich I had always particularly enjoyed. The shouts of newspaper boys in\nthe already languid air, the last calls of birds in the public garden, the cries\nof sandwich vendors, the screech of streetcars at the steep corners of the\nupper town, and that faint rustling overhead as darkness sifted down upon\nthe harbor—all these sounds made my return to prison like a blind man’s\njourney along a route whose every inch he knows by heart.\n\nYes, this was the evening hour when—how long ago it seemed!—I always\nfelt so well content with life. Then, what awaited me was a night of easy,\ndreamless sleep. This was the same hour, but with a difference; I was\nreturning to a cell, and what awaited me was a night haunted by\nforebodings of the coming day. And so I learned that familiar paths traced\nin the dusk of summer evenings may lead as well to prisons as to innocent,\nuntroubled sleep.\n\nIV\nIT is always interesting, even in the prisoner’s dock, to hear oneself being\ntalked about. And certainly in the speeches of my lawyer and the\nprosecuting counsel a great deal was said about me; more, in fact, about me\npersonally than about my crime.\nReally there wasn’t any very great difference between the two speeches.\nCounsel for the defense raised his arms to heaven and pleaded guilty, but\nwith extenuating circumstances. The Prosecutor made similar gestures; he\nagreed that I was guilty, but denied extenuating circumstances.\n\nOne thing about this phase of the trial was rather irksome. Quite often,\ninterested as I was in what they had to say, I was tempted to put in a word,\nmyself. But my lawyer had advised me not to. “You won’t do your case any\ngood by talking,” he had warned me. In fact, there seemed to be a\nconspiracy to exclude me from the proceedings; I wasn’t to have any say\nand my fate was to be decided out of hand.\n\nIt was quite an effort at times for me to refrain from cutting them all short,\nand saying: “But, damn it all, who’s on trial in this court, I’d like to know?\nIt’s a serious matter for a man, being accused of murder. And I’ve\nsomething really important to tell you.”\n\nHowever, on second thoughts, I found I had nothing to say. In any case, I\nmust admit that hearing oneself talked about loses its interest very soon.\nThe Prosecutor’s speech, especially, began to bore me before he was\nhalfway through it. The only things that really caught my attention were\noccasional phrases, his gestures, and some elaborate tirades—but these\nwere isolated patches.\n\nWhat he was aiming at, I gathered, was to show that my crime was\npremeditated. I remember his saying at one moment, “I can prove this,\ngentlemen of the jury, to the hilt. First, you have the facts of the crime;\nwhich are as clear as daylight. And then you have what I may call the night\nside of this case, the dark workings of a criminal mentality.”\n\nHe began by summing up the facts, from my mother’s death onward. He\nstressed my heartlessness, my inability to state Mother’s age, my visit to the\nswimming pool where I met Marie, our matinee at the pictures where a\nFernandel film was showing, and finally my return with Marie to my\nrooms. I didn’t quite follow his remarks at first, as he kept on mentioning\n“the prisoner’s mistress,” whereas for me she was just “Marie.” Then he\ncame to the subject of Raymond. It seemed to me that his way of treating\nthe facts showed a certain shrewdness. All he said sounded quite plausible.\nI’d written the letter in collusion with Raymond so as to entice his mistress\nto his room and subject her to ill-treatment by a man “of more than dubious\nreputation.” Then, on the beach, I’d provoked a brawl with Raymond’s\nenemies, in the course of which Raymond was wounded. I’d asked him for\nhis revolver and gone back by myself with the intention of using it. Then\nI’d shot the Arab. After the first shot I waited. Then, “to be certain of\nmaking a good job of it,” I fired four more shots deliberately, point-blank,\nand in cold blood, at my victim.\n\n“That is my case,” he said. “I have described to you the series of events\nwhich led this man to kill the deceased, fully aware of what he was doing. I\nemphasize this point. We are not concerned with an act of homicide\ncommitted on a sudden impulse which might serve as extenuation. I ask you\nto note, gentlemen of the jury, that the prisoner is an educated man. You\nwill have observed the way in which he answered my questions; he is\nintelligent and he knows the value of words. And I repeat that it is quite\nimpossible to assume that, when he committed the crime, he was unaware\nwhat he was doing.”\n\nI noticed that he laid stress on my “intelligence.” It puzzled me rather why\nwhat would count as a good point in an ordinary person should be used\nagainst an accused man as an overwhelming proof of his guilt. While\nthinking this over, I missed what he said next, until I heard him exclaim\nindignantly: “And has he uttered a word of regret for his most odious\ncrime? Not one word, gentlemen. Not once in the course of these\nproceedings did this man show the least contrition.”\n\nTurning toward the dock, he pointed a finger at me, and went on in the\nsame strain. I really couldn’t understand why he harped on this point so\nmuch. Of course, I had to own that he was right; I didn’t feel much regret\nfor what I’d done. Still, to my mind he overdid it, and I’d have liked to have\na chance of explaining to him, in a quite friendly, almost affectionate way,\nthat I have never been able really to regret anything in all my life. I’ve\nalways been far too much absorbed in the present moment, or the\nimmediate future, to think back. Of course, in the position into which I had\nbeen forced, there was no question of my speaking to anyone in that tone. I\nhadn’t the right to show any friendly feeling or possess good intentions.\nAnd I tried to follow what came next, as the Prosecutor was now\nconsidering what he called my “soul.”\n\nHe said he’d studied it closely—and had found a blank, “literally nothing,\ngentlemen of the jury.” Really, he said, I had no soul, there was nothing\nhuman about me, not one of those moral qualities which normal men\npossess had any place in my mentality. “No doubt,” he added, “we should\nnot reproach him with this. We cannot blame a man for lacking what it was\nnever in his power to acquire. But in a criminal court the wholly passive\nideal of tolerance must give place to a sterner, loftier ideal, that of justice.\nEspecially when this lack of every decent instinct is such as that of the man\nbefore you, a menace to society.” He proceeded to discuss my conduct\ntoward my mother, repeating what he had said in the course of the hearing.\nBut he spoke at much greater length of my crime—at such length, indeed,\nthat I lost the thread and was conscious only of the steadily increasing heat.\n\nA moment came when the Prosecutor paused and, after a short silence, said\nin a low, vibrant voice: “This same court, gentlemen, will be called on to try\ntomorrow that most odious of crimes, the murder of a father by his son.” To\nhis mind, such a crime was almost unimaginable. But, he ventured to hope,\njustice would be meted out without paltering. And yet, he made bold to say,\nthe horror that even the crime of parricide inspired in him paled beside the\nloathing inspired by my callousness.\n\n“This man, who is morally guilty of his mother’s death, is no less unfit to\nhave a place in the community than that other man who did to death the\nfather that begat him. And, indeed, the one crime led on to the other; the\nfirst of these two criminals, the man in the dock, set a precedent, if I may\nput it so, and authorized the second crime. Yes, gentlemen, I am\nconvinced”—here he raised his voice a tone—“that you will not find I am\nexaggerating the case against the prisoner when I say that he is also guilty\nof the murder to be tried tomorrow in this court. And I look to you for a\nverdict accordingly.”\n\nThe Prosecutor paused again, to wipe the sweat off his face. He then\nexplained that his duty was a painful one, but he would do it without\nflinching. “This man has, I repeat, no place in a community whose basic\nprinciples he flouts without compunction. Nor, heartless as he is, has he any\nclaim to mercy. I ask you to impose the extreme penalty of the law; and I\nask it without a qualm. In the course of a long career, in which it has often\nbeen my duty to ask for a capital sentence, never have I felt that painful\nduty weigh so little on my mind as in the present case. In demanding a\nverdict of murder without extenuating circumstances, I am following not\nonly the dictates of my conscience and a sacred obligation, but also those of\nthe natural and righteous indignation I feel at the sight of a criminal devoid\nof the least spark of human feeling.”\n\nWhen the Prosecutor sat down there was a longish silence. Personally I was\nquite overcome by the heat and my amazement at what I had been hearing.\nThe presiding judge gave a short cough, and asked me in a very low tone if\nI had anything to say. I rose, and as I felt in the mood to speak, I said the\nfirst thing that crossed my mind: that I’d had no intention of killing the\nArab. The Judge replied that this statement would be taken into\nconsideration by the court. Meanwhile he would be glad to hear, before my\ncounsel addressed the court, what were the motives of my crime. So far, he\nmust admit, he hadn’t fully understood the grounds of my defense.\n\nI tried to explain that it was because of the sun, but I spoke too quickly and\nran my words into each other. I was only too conscious that it sounded\nnonsensical, and, in fact, I heard people tittering.\n\nMy lawyer shrugged his shoulders. Then he was directed to address the\ncourt, in his turn. But all he did was to point out the lateness of the hour and\nto ask for an adjournment till the following afternoon. To this the judge\nagreed.\n\nWhen I was brought back next day, the electric fans were still churning up\nthe heavy air and the jurymen plying their gaudy little fans in a sort of\nsteady rhythm. The speech for the defense seemed to me interminable. At\none moment, however, I pricked up my ears; it was when I heard him\nsaying: “It is true I killed a man.” He went on in the same strain, saying “I”\nwhen he referred to me. It seemed so queer that I bent toward the policeman\non my right and asked him to explain. He told me to shut up; then, after a\nmoment, whispered: “They all do that.” It seemed to me that the idea\nbehind it was still further to exclude me from the case, to put me off the\nmap. so to speak, by substituting the lawyer for myself. Anyway, it hardly\nmattered; I already felt worlds away from this courtroom and its tedious\n“proceedings.”\n\nMy lawyer, in any case, struck me as feeble to the point of being ridiculous.\nHe hurried through his plea of provocation, and then he, too, started in\nabout my soul. But I had an impression that he had much less talent than the\nProsecutor.\n\n“I, too,” he said, “have closely studied this man’s soul; but, unlike my\nlearned friend for the prosecution, I have found something there. Indeed, I\nmay say that I have read the prisoner’s mind like an open book.” What he\nhad read there was that I was an excellent young fellow, a steady,\nconscientious worker who did his best by his employer; that I was popular\nwith everyone and sympathetic in others’ troubles. According to him I was\na dutiful son, who had supported his mother as long as he was able. After\nanxious consideration I had reached the conclusion that, by entering a\nhome, the old lady would have comforts that my means didn’t permit me to\nprovide for her. “I am astounded, gentlemen,” he added, “by the attitude\ntaken up by my learned friend in referring to this Home. Surely if proof be\nneeded of the excellence of such institutions, we need only remember that\nthey are promoted and financed by a government department.” I noticed\nthat he made no reference to the funeral, and this seemed to me a serious\nomission. But, what with his long-windedness, the endless days and hours\nthey had been discussing my “soul,” and the rest of it, I found that my mind\nhad gone blurred; everything was dissolving into a grayish, watery haze.\n\nOnly one incident stands out; toward the end, while my counsel rambled on,\nI heard the tin trumpet of an ice-cream vendor in the street, a small, shrill\nsound cutting across the flow of words. And then a rush of memories went\nthrough my mind—memories of a life which was mine no longer and had\nonce provided me with the surest, humblest pleasures: warm smells of\nsummer, my favorite streets, the sky at evening, Marie’s dresses and her\nlaugh. The futility of what was happening here seemed to take me by the\nthroat, I felt like vomiting, and I had only one idea: to get it over, to go back\nto my cell, and sleep ... and sleep.\n\nDimly I heard my counsel making his last appeal.\n“Gentlemen of the jury, surely you will not send to his death a decent, hard-\nworking young man, because for one tragic moment he lost his self-control?\nIs he not sufficiently punished by the lifelong remorse that is to be his lot? I\nconfidently await your verdict, the only verdict possible—that of homicide\nwith extenuating circumstances.”\n\nThe court rose, and the lawyer sat down, looking thoroughly exhausted.\nSome of his colleagues came to him and shook his hand. “You put up a\nmagnificent show, old man,” I heard one of them say. Another lawyer even\ncalled me to witness: “Fine, wasn’t it?” I agreed, but insincerely; I was far\ntoo tired to judge if it had been “fine” or otherwise.\n\nMeanwhile the day was ending and the heat becoming less intense. By\nsome vague sounds that reached me from the street I knew that the cool of\nthe evening had set in. We all sat on, waiting. And what we all were waiting\nfor really concerned nobody but me. I looked round the courtroom. It was\nexactly as it had been on the first day. I met the eyes of the journalist in\ngray and the robot woman. This reminded me that not once during the\nwhole hearing had I tried to catch Marie’s eye. It wasn’t that I’d forgotten\nher; only I was too preoccupied. I saw her now, seated between Céleste and\nRaymond. She gave me a little wave of her hand, as if to say, “At last!” She\nwas smiling, but I could tell that she was rather anxious. But my heart\nseemed turned to stone, and I couldn’t even return her smile.\n\nThe judges came back to their seats. Someone read out to the jury, very\nrapidly, a string of questions. I caught a word here and there. “Murder of\nmalice aforethought ... Provocation ... Extenuating circumstances.” The jury\nwent out, and I was taken to the little room where I had already waited. My\nlawyer came to see me; he was very talkative and showed more cordiality\nand confidence than ever before. He assured me that all would go well and\nI’d get off with a few years’ imprisonment or transportation. I asked him\nwhat were the chances of getting the sentence quashed. He said there was\nno chance of that. He had not raised any point of law, as this was apt to\nprejudice the jury. And it was difficult to get a judgment quashed except on\ntechnical grounds. I saw his point, and agreed. Looking at the matter\ndispassionately, I shared his view. Otherwise there would be no end to\nlitigation. “In any case,” the lawyer said, “you can appeal in the ordinary\nway. But I’m convinced the verdict will be favorable.”\n\nWe waited for quite a while, a good three quarters of an hour, I should say.\nThen a bell rang. My lawyer left me, saying:\n\n“The foreman of the jury will read out the answers. You will be called on\nafter that to hear the judgment.”\n\nSome doors banged. I heard people hurrying down flights of steps, but\ncouldn’t tell whether they were near by or distant. Then I heard a voice\ndroning away in the courtroom.\n\nWhen the bell rang again and I stepped back into the dock, the silence of\nthe courtroom closed in round me, and with the silence came a queer\nsensation when I noticed that, for the. first time, the young journalist kept\nhis eyes averted. I didn’t look in Marie’s direction. In fact, I had no time to\nlook, as the presiding judge had already started pronouncing a rigmarole to\nthe effect that “in the name of the French people” I was to be decapitated in\nsome public place.\n\nIt seemed to me then that I could interpret the look on the faces of those\npresent; it was one of almost respectful sympathy. The policemen, too,\nhandled me very gently. The lawyer placed his hand on my wrist. I had\nstopped thinking altogether. I heard the Judge’s voice asking if I had\nanything more to say. After thinking for a moment, I answered, “No.” Then\nthe policemen led me out.\n\nV\nI HAVE just refused, for the third time, to see the prison chaplain. I have\nnothing to say to him, don’t feel like talking—and shall be seeing him quite\nsoon enough, anyway. The only thing that interests me now is the problem\nof circumventing the machine, learning if the inevitable admits a loophole.\n\nThey have moved me to another cell. In this one, lying on my back, I can\nsee the sky, and there is nothing else to see. All my time is spent in\nwatching the slowly changing colors of the sky, as day moves on to night. I\nput my hands behind my head, gaze up, and wait.\nThis problem of a loophole obsesses me; I am always wondering if there\nhave been cases of condemned prisoners’ escaping from the implacable\nmachinery of justice at the last moment, breaking through the police\ncordon, vanishing in the nick of time before the guillotine falls. Often and\noften I blame myself for not having given more attention to accounts of\npublic executions. One should always take an interest in such matters.\nThere’s never any knowing what one may come to. Like everyone else I’d\nread descriptions of executions in the papers. But technical books dealing\nwith this subject must certainly exist; only I’d never felt sufficiently\ninterested to look them up. And in these books I might have found escape\nstories. Surely they’d have told me that in one case, anyhow, the wheels had\nstopped; that once, if only once, in that inexorable march of events, chance\nor luck had played a happy part. Just once! In a way I think that single\ninstance would have satisfied me. My emotion would have done the rest.\nThe papers often talk of “a debt owed to society”—a debt which, according\nto them, must be paid by the offender. But talk of that sort doesn’t touch the\nimagination. No, the one thing that counted for me was the possibility of\nmaking a dash for it and defeating their bloodthirsty rite; of a mad stampede\nto freedom that would anyhow give me a moment’s hope, the gambler’s last\nthrow. Naturally, all that “hope” could come to was to be knocked down at\nthe corner of a street or picked off by a bullet in my back. But, all things\nconsidered, even this luxury was forbidden me; I was caught in the rattrap\nirrevocably.\n\nTry as I might, I couldn’t stomach this brutal certitude. For really, when one\ncame to think of it, there was a disproportion between the judgment on\nwhich it was based and the unalterable sequence of events starting from the\nmoment when that judgment was delivered. The fact that the verdict was\nread out at eight P.M. rather than at five, the fact that it might have been\nquite different, that it was given by men who change their underclothes, and\nwas credited to so vague an entity as the “French people”—for that matter,\nwhy not to the Chinese or the German people?—all these facts seemed to\ndeprive the court’s decision of much of its gravity. Yet I could but recognize\nthat, from the moment the verdict was given, its effects became as cogent,\nas tangible, as, for example, this wall against which I was lying, pressing\nmy back to it.\nWhen such thoughts crossed my mind, I remembered a story Mother used\nto tell me about my father. I never set eyes on him. Perhaps the only things I\nreally knew about him were what Mother had told me. One of these was\nthat he’d gone to see a murderer executed. The mere thought of it turned his\nstomach. But he’d seen it through and, on coming home, was violently sick.\nAt the time, I found my father’s conduct rather disgusting. But now I\nunderstood; it was so natural. How had I failed to recognize that nothing\nwas more important than an execution; that, viewed from one angle, it’s the\nonly thing that can genuinely interest a man? And I decided that, if ever I\ngot out of jail, I’d attend every execution that took place. I was unwise, no\ndoubt, even to consider this possibility. For, the moment I’d pictured myself\nin freedom, standing behind a double rank of policemen—on the right side\nof the line, so to speak—the mere thought of being an onlooker who comes\nto see the show, and can go home and vomit afterward, flooded my mind\nwith a wild, absurd exultation. It was a stupid thing to let my imagination\nrun away with me like that; a moment later I had a shivering fit and had to\nwrap myself closely in my blanket. But my teeth went on chattering;\nnothing would stop them.\n\nStill, obviously, one can’t be sensible all the time. Another equally\nridiculous fancy of mine was to frame new laws, altering the penalties.\nWhat was wanted, to my mind, was to give the criminal a chance, if only a\ndog’s chance; say, one chance in a thousand. There might be some drug, or\ncombination of drugs, which would kill the patient (I thought of him as “the\npatient”) nine hundred and ninety times in a thousand. That he should know\nthis was, of course, essential. For after taking much thought, calmly, I came\nto the conclusion that what was wrong about the guillotine was that the\ncondemned man had no chance at all, absolutely none. In fact, the patient’s\ndeath had been ordained irrevocably. It was a foregone conclusion. If by\nsome fluke the knife didn’t do its job, they started again. So it came to this,\nthat—against the grain, no doubt—the condemned man had to hope the\napparatus was in good working order! This, I thought, was a flaw in the\nsystem; and, on the face of it, my view was sound enough. On the other\nhand, I had to admit it proved the efficiency of the system. It came to this;\nthe man under sentence was obliged to collaborate mentally, it was in his\ninterest that all should go off without a hitch.\nAnother thing I had to recognize was that, until now, I’d had wrong ideas\non the subject. For some reason I’d always supposed that one had to go up\nsteps and climb on to a scaffold, to be guillotined. Probably that was\nbecause of the 1789 Revolution; I mean, what I’d learned about it at school,\nand the pictures I had seen. Then one morning I remembered a photograph\nthe newspapers had featured on the occasion of the execution of a famous\ncriminal. Actually the apparatus stood on the ground; there was nothing\nvery impressing about it, and it was much narrower than I’d imagined. It\nstruck me as rather odd that picture had escaped my memory until now.\nWhat had struck me at the time was the neat appearance of the guillotine;\nits shining surfaces and finish reminded me of some laboratory instrument.\nOne always has exaggerated ideas about what one doesn’t know. Now I had\nto admit it seemed a very simple process, getting guillotined; the machine is\non the same level as the man, and he walks toward it as he steps forward to\nmeet somebody he knows. In a sense, that, too, was disappointing. The\nbusiness of climbing a scaffold, leaving the world below, so to speak, gave\nsomething for a man’s imagination to get hold of. But, as it was, the\nmachine dominated everything; they killed you discreetly, with a hint of\nshame and much efficiency.\n\nThere were two other things about which I was always thinking: the dawn\nand my appeal. However, I did my best to keep my mind off these thoughts.\nI lay down, looked up at the sky, and forced myself to study it. When the\nlight began to turn green I knew that night was coming. Another thing I did\nto deflect the course of my thoughts was to listen to my heart. I couldn’t\nimagine that this faint throbbing which had been with me for so long would\never cease. Imagination has never been one of my strong points. Still, I tried\nto picture a moment when the beating of my heart no longer echoed in my\nhead. But, in vain. The dawn and my appeal were still there. And I ended by\nbelieving it was a silly thing to try to force one’s thoughts out of their\nnatural groove.\n\nThey always came for one at dawn; that much I knew. So, really, all my\nnights were spent in waiting for that dawn. I have never liked being taken\nby surprise. When something happens to me I want to be ready for it. That’s\nwhy I got into the habit of sleeping off and on in the daytime and watching\nthrough the night for the first hint of daybreak in the dark dome above. The\nworst period of the night was that vague hour when, I knew, they usually\ncome; once it was after midnight I waited, listening intently. Never before\nhad my ears perceived so many noises, such tiny sounds. Still, I must say I\nwas lucky in one respect; never during any of those periods did I hear\nfootsteps. Mother used to say that however miserable one is, there’s always\nsomething to be thankful for. And each morning, when the sky brightened\nand light began to flood my cell, I agreed with her. Because I might just as\nwell have heard footsteps, and felt my heart shattered into bits. Even though\nthe faintest rustle sent me hurrying to the door and, pressing an ear to the\nrough, cold wood, I listened so intently that I could hear my breathing,\nquick and hoarse like a dog’s panting—even so there was an end; my heart\nhadn’t split, and I knew I had another twenty-four hours’ respite.\n\nThen all day there was my appeal to think about. I made the most of this\nidea, studying my effects so as to squeeze out the maximum of consolation.\nThus, I always began by assuming the worst; my appeal was dismissed.\nThat meant, of course, I was to die. Sooner than others, obviously. “But,” I\nreminded myself, “it’s common knowledge that life isn’t worth living,\nanyhow.” And, on a wide view, I could see that it makes little difference\nwhether one dies at the age of thirty or threescore and ten—since, in either\ncase, other men and women will continue living, the world will go on as\nbefore. Also, whether I died now or forty years hence, this business of\ndying had to be got through, inevitably. Still, somehow this line of thought\nwasn’t as consoling as it should have been; the idea of all those years of life\nin hand was a galling reminder! However, I could argue myself out of it, by\npicturing what would have been my feelings when my term was up, and\ndeath had cornered me. Once you’re up against it, the precise manner of\nyour death has obviously small importance. Therefore—but it was hard not\nto lose the thread of the argument leading up to that “therefore”—I should\nbe prepared to face the dismissal of my appeal.\n\nAt this stage, but only at this stage, I had, so to speak, the right, and\naccordingly I gave myself leave, to consider the other alternative; that my\nappeal was successful. And then the trouble was to calm down that sudden\nrush of joy racing through my body and even bringing tears to my eyes. But\nit was up to me to bring my nerves to heel and steady my mind; for, even in\nconsidering this possibility, I had to keep some order in my thoughts, so as\nto make my consolations, as regards the first alternative, more plausible.\nWhen I’d succeeded, I had earned a good hour’s peace of mind; and that,\nanyhow, was something.\n\nIt was at one of these moments that I refused once again to see the chaplain.\nI was lying down and could mark the summer evening coming on by a soft\ngolden glow spreading across the sky. I had just turned down my appeal,\nand felt my blood circulating with slow, steady throbs. No, I didn’t want to\nsee the chaplain. ... Then I did something I hadn’t done for quite a while; I\nfell to thinking about Marie. She hadn’t written for ages; probably, I\nsurmised, she had grown tired of being the mistress of a man sentenced to\ndeath. Or she might be ill, or dead. After all, such things happen. How\ncould I have known about it, since, apart from our two bodies, separated\nnow, there was no link between us, nothing to remind us of each other?\nSupposing she were dead, her memory would mean nothing; I couldn’t feel\nan interest in a dead girl. This seemed to me quite normal; just as I realized\npeople would soon forget me once I was dead. I couldn’t even say that this\nwas hard to stomach; really, there’s no idea to which one doesn’t get\nacclimatized in time.\n\nMy thoughts had reached this point when the chaplain walked in,\nunannounced. I couldn’t help giving a start on seeing him. He noticed this\nevidently, as he promptly told me not to be alarmed. I reminded him that\nusually his visits were at another hour, and for a pretty grim occasion. This,\nhe replied, was just a friendly visit; it had no concern with my appeal, about\nwhich he knew nothing. Then he sat down on my bed, asking me to sit\nbeside him. I refused—not because I had anything against him; he seemed a\nmild, amiable man.\n\nHe remained quite still at first, his arms resting on his knees, his eyes fixed\non his hands. They were slender but sinewy hands, which made me think of\ntwo nimble little animals. Then he gently rubbed them together. He stayed\nso long in the same position that for a while I almost forgot he was there.\n\nAll of a sudden he jerked his head up and looked me in the eyes.\n\n“Why,” he asked, “don’t you let me come to see you?”\nI explained that I didn’t believe in God.\n\n“Are you really so sure of that?”\n\nI said I saw no point in troubling my head about the matter; whether I\nbelieved or didn’t was, to my mind, a question of so little importance.\n\nHe then leaned back against the wall, laying his hands flat on his thighs.\nAlmost without seeming to address me, he remarked that he’d often noticed\none fancies one is quite sure about something, when in point of fact one\nisn’t. When I said nothing, he looked at me again, and asked:\n\n“Don’t you agree?”\n\nI said that seemed quite possible. But, though I mightn’t be so sure about\nwhat interested me, I was absolutely sure about what didn’t interest me.\nAnd the question he had raised didn’t interest me at all.\n\nHe looked away and, without altering his posture, asked if it was because I\nfelt utterly desperate that I spoke like this. I explained that it wasn’t despair\nI felt, but fear—which was natural enough.\n\n“In that case,” he said firmly, “God can help you. All the men I’ve seen in\nyour position turned to Him in their time of trouble.”\n\nObviously, I replied, they were at liberty to do so, if they felt like it. I,\nhowever, didn’t want to be helped, and I hadn’t time to work up interest for\nsomething that didn’t interest me.\n\nHe fluttered his hands fretfully; then, sitting up, smoothed out his cassock.\nWhen this was done he began talking again, addressing me as “my friend.”\nIt wasn’t because I’d been condemned to death, he said, that he spoke to me\nin this way. In his opinion every man on the earth was under sentence of\ndeath.\n\nThere, I interrupted him; that wasn’t the same thing, I pointed out, and,\nwhat’s more, could be no consolation.\nHe nodded. “Maybe. Still, if you don’t die soon, you’ll die one day. And\nthen the same question will arise. How will you face that terrible, final\nhour?”\n\nI replied that I’d face it exactly as I was facing it now.\n\nThereat he stood up, and looked me straight in the eyes. It was a trick I\nknew well. I used to amuse myself trying it on Emmanuel and Céleste, and\nnine times out of ten they’d look away uncomfortably. I could see the\nchaplain was an old hand at it, as his gaze never faltered. And his voice was\nquite steady when he said: “Have you no hope at all? Do you really think\nthat when you die you die outright, and nothing remains?”\n\nI said: “Yes.”\n\nHe dropped his eyes and sat down again. He was truly sorry for me, he said.\nIt must make life unbearable for a man, to think as I did.\n\nThe priest was beginning to bore me, and, resting a shoulder on the wall,\njust beneath the little skylight, I looked away. Though I didn’t trouble much\nto follow what he said, I gathered he was questioning me again. Presently\nhis tone became agitated, urgent, and, as I realized that he was genuinely\ndistressed, I began to pay more attention.\n\nHe said he felt convinced my appeal would succeed, but I was saddled with\na load of guilt, of which I must get rid. In his view man’s justice was a vain\nthing; only God’s justice mattered. I pointed out that the former had\ncondemned me. Yes, he agreed, but it hadn’t absolved me from my sin. I\ntold him that I wasn’t conscious of any “sin”; all I knew was that I’d been\nguilty of a criminal offense. Well, I was paying the penalty of that offense,\nand no one had the right to expect anything more of me.\n\nJust then he got up again, and it struck me that if he wanted to move in this\ntiny cell, almost the only choice lay between standing up and sitting down. I\nwas staring at the floor. He took a single step toward me, and halted, as if he\ndidn’t dare to come nearer. Then he looked up through the bars at the sky.\n“You’re mistaken, my son,” he said gravely. “There’s more that might be\nrequired of you. And perhaps it will be required of you.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“You might be asked to see ...”\n\n“To see what?”\n\nSlowly the priest gazed round my cell, and I was struck by the sadness of\nhis voice when he replied:\n\n“These stone walls, I know it only too well, are steeped in human suffering.\nI’ve never been able to look at them without a shudder. And yet—believe\nme, I am speaking from the depths of my heart—I know that even the\nwretchedest amongst you have sometimes seen, taking form against that\ngrayness, a divine face. It’s that face you are asked to see.”\n\nThis roused me a little. I informed him that I’d been staring at those walls\nfor months; there was nobody, nothing in the world, I knew better than I\nknew them. And once upon a time, perhaps, I used to try to see a face. But\nit was a sun-gold face, lit up with desire—Marie’s face. I had no luck; I’d\nnever seen it, and now I’d given up trying. Indeed, I’d never seen anything\n“taking form,” as he called it, against those gray walls.\n\nThe chaplain gazed at me with a sort of sadness. I now had my back to the\nwall and light was flowing over my forehead. He muttered some words I\ndidn’t catch; then abruptly asked if he might kiss me. I said, “No.” Then he\nturned, came up to the wall, and slowly drew his hand along it.\n\n“Do you really love these earthly things so very much?” he asked in a low\nvoice.\n\nI made no reply.\n\nFor quite a while he kept his eyes averted. His presence was getting more\nand more irksome, and I was on the point of telling him to go, and leave me\nin peace, when all of a sudden he swung round on me, and burst out\npassionately:\n\n“No! No! I refuse to believe it. I’m sure you’ve often wished there was an\nafterlife.”\n\nOf course I had, I told him. Everybody has that wish at times. But that had\nno more importance than wishing to be rich, or to swim very fast, or to have\na better-shaped mouth. It was in the same order of things. I was going on in\nthe same vein, when he cut in with a question. How did I picture the life\nafter the grave?\n\nI fairly bawled out at him: “A life in which I can remember this life on\nearth. That’s all I want of it.” And in the same breath I told him I’d had\nenough of his company.\n\nBut, apparently, he had more to say on the subject of God. I went close up\nto him and made a last attempt to explain that I’d very little time left, and I\nwasn’t going to waste it on God.\n\nThen he tried to change the subject by asking me why I hadn’t once\naddressed him as “Father,” seeing that he was a priest. That irritated me still\nmore, and I told him he wasn’t my father; quite the contrary, he was on the\nothers’ side.\n\n“No, no, my son,” he said, laying his hand on my shoulder. “I’m on your\nside, though you don’t realize it—because your heart is hardened. But I\nshall pray for you.”\n\nThen, I don’t know how it was, but something seemed to break inside me,\nand I started yelling at the top of my voice. I hurled insults at him, I told\nhim not to waste his rotten prayers on me; it was better to burn than to\ndisappear. I’d taken him by the neckband of his cassock, and, in a sort of\necstasy of joy and rage, I poured out on him all the thoughts that had been\nsimmering in my brain. He seemed so cocksure, you see. And yet none of\nhis certainties was worth one strand of a woman’s hair. Living as he did,\nlike a corpse, he couldn’t even be sure of being alive. It might look as if my\nhands were empty. Actually, I was sure of myself, sure about everything, far\nsurer than he; sure of my present life and of the death that was coming.\nThat, no doubt, was all I had; but at least that certainty was something I\ncould get my teeth into—just as it had got its teeth into me. I’d been right, I\nwas still right, I was always right. I’d passed my life in a certain way, and I\nmight have passed it in a different way, if I’d felt like it. I’d acted thus, and\nI hadn’t acted otherwise; I hadn’t done x, whereas I had done y or z. And\nwhat did that mean? That, all the time, I’d been waiting for this present\nmoment, for that dawn, tomorrow’s or another day’s, which was to justify\nme. Nothing, nothing had the least importance and I knew quite well why.\nHe, too, knew why. From the dark horizon of my future a sort of slow,\npersistent breeze had been blowing toward me, all my life long, from the\nyears that were to come. And on its way that breeze had leveled out all the\nideas that people tried to foist on me in the equally unreal years I then was\nliving through. What difference could they make to me, the deaths of\nothers, or a mother’s love, or his God; or the way a man decides to live, the\nfate he thinks he chooses, since one and the same fate was bound to\n“choose” not only me but thousands of millions of privileged people who,\nlike him, called themselves my brothers. Surely, surely he must see that?\nEvery man alive was privileged; there was only one class of men, the\nprivileged class. All alike would be condemned to die one day; his turn, too,\nwould come like the others’. And what difference could it make if, after\nbeing charged with murder, he were executed because he didn’t weep at his\nmother’s funeral, since it all came to the same thing in the end? The same\nthing for Salamano’s wife and for Salamano’s dog. That little robot woman\nwas as “guilty” as the girl from Paris who had married Masson, or as Marie,\nwho wanted me to marry her. What did it matter if Raymond was as much\nmy pal as Céleste, who was a far worthier man? What did it matter if at this\nvery moment Marie was kissing a new boy friend? As a condemned man\nhimself, couldn’t he grasp what I meant by that dark wind blowing from my\nfuture? ...\n\nI had been shouting so much that I’d lost my breath, and just then the jailers\nrushed in and started trying to release the chaplain from my grip. One of\nthem made as if to strike me. The chaplain quietened them down, then\ngazed at me for a moment without speaking. I could see tears in his eyes.\nThen he turned and left the cell.\nOnce he’d gone, I felt calm again. But all this excitement had exhausted me\nand I dropped heavily on to my sleeping plank. I must have had a longish\nsleep, for, when I woke, the stars were shining down on my face. Sounds of\nthe countryside came faintly in, and the cool night air, veined with smells’\nof earth and salt, fanned my cheeks. The marvelous peace of the sleepbound\nsummer night flooded through me like a tide. Then, just on the edge of\ndaybreak, I heard a steamer’s siren. People were starting on a voyage to a\nworld which had ceased to concern me forever. Almost for the first time in\nmany months I thought of my mother. And now, it seemed to me, I\nunderstood why at her life’s end she had taken on a “fiancé”; why she’d\nplayed at making a fresh start. There, too, in that Home where lives were\nflickering out, the dusk came as a mournful solace. With death so near,\nMother must have felt like someone on the brink of freedom, ready to start\nlife all over again. No one, no one in the world had any right to weep for\nher. And I, too, felt ready to start life all over again. It was as if that great\nrush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at\nthe dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I\nlaid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so\nlike myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I’d been happy, and\nthat I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely,\nall that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should\nbe a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of\nexecration.\n\nTHE END."}
