She reflects on the societal influence that deems women’s roles as secondary to men’s, and how these expectations contribute to her feelings of entrapment.

**4. Return to the Home**
After her internship, Esther returns to her hometown. Despite being surrounded by family and friends, she feels isolated and trapped within the confines of her own mind. Conversations with her mother and acquaintances reveal the stifling and outdated expectations placed on women, further solidifying Esther's wish to escape her reality.

**5. The Role of Relationships**
Esther navigates various relationships throughout the novel, including the complicated dynamics with her boyfriend Buddy Willard.

Buddy represents a traditional male perspective that conflicts with Esther's quest for independence and self-identity. 

**6. Exploration of Identity**
